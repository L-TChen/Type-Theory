abstract = {We study three operational models of name-passing process calculi: coalgebras on (pre)sheaves, indexed labelled transition systems, and history dependent automata. The coalgebraic model is considered both for presheaves over the category of finite sets and injections, and for its subcategory of atomic sheaves known as the Schanuel topos. Each coalgebra induces an indexed labelled transition system. Such transition systems are characterised, relating the coalgebraic approach to an existing model of name-passing. Further, we consider internal labelled transition systems within the sheaf topos, and axiomatise a class that is in precise correspondence with the coalgebraic and the indexed labelled transition system models. By establishing and exploiting the equivalence of the Schanuel topos with a category of named-sets, these internal labelled transition systems are also related to the theory of history dependent automata. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The main contributions of this paper lie in extending the notion of Sahlqvist axioms to our generalized setting and proving both a correspondence and a canonicity result for distributive modal logics axiomatized by Sahlqvist axioms.

The novelty is that we have one structure for both states and actions and thus our models do not involve the "change-of- model" phenomena that arise when using Kripke models. However, we prove that the usual models can be constructed from ours by categorical adjunction. The generality and abstraction of our coalgebraic model turns out to be extremely useful in proving preservation properties of update. In particular, we prove that positive knowledge is preserved and acquired as a result of epistemic update. We also prove common and nested knowledge properties of epistemic updates induced by specific epistemic actions such as public and private announcements, lying, and in particular unsafe actions of security protocols. Our model directly gives rise to a coalgebraic logic with both dynamic and epistemic modalities. We prove a soundness and completeness result for this logic, and illustrate the applicability of the logic by deriving knowledge properties of a simple security protocol. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In this paper, we make use of the coalgebraic view on systems to investigate, in a uniform way, under which conditions calculi that are sound and complete with respect to behavioral equivalence can be extended to a coarser coalgebraic language equivalence, which arises from a generalised powerset construction that determinises coalgebras. We show that soundness and completeness are established by proving that expressions modulo axioms of a calculus form the rational fixpoint of the given type functor. Our main result is that the rational fixpoint of the functor $FT$, where $T$ is a monad describing the branching of the systems (e.g. non-determinism, weights, probability etc.), has as a quotient the rational fixpoint of the "determinised" type functor $\bar F$, a lifting of $F$ to the category of $T$-algebras. We apply our framework to the concrete example of weighted automata, for which we present a new sound and complete calculus for weighted language equivalence. As a special case, we obtain non-deterministic automata, where we recover Rabinovich's sound and complete calculus for language equivalence.},

The logic is based on the distinction between (probabilistic) "systems" and (nonprobabilistic) "observations": using the modal mu-calculus, one may specify sets of observations, and the semantics of our logic then enable statements to be made about the measures of such sets at various system states. The logic may be used to encode a variety of probabilistic modal and temporal logics; in addition, the model-checking problem for it may be reduced to the calculation of solutions to systems of non-linear equations. Finally, the logic induces an equivalence on RPLTSs that coincides with accepted notions of probabilistic bisimulation in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

We also utilise a recently introduced posterior sampling mechanism, for which we prove bounds for the specific but general case of discrete Bayesian networks; and we introduce a maximum-a-posteriori private mechanism. Our analysis includes utility and privacy bounds, with a novel focus on the influence of graph structure on privacy. Worked examples and experiments with Bayesian na{\"i}ve Bayes and Bayesian linear regression illustrate the application of our mechanisms.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate formal mechanisms to enable designers to decompose specifications (stated in a given logic) into several interacting components in such a way that the composition of these components preserves their encapsulation and internal non-determinism. The preservation of encapsulation (or locality) enables a modular form of reasoning over specifications, while the conservation of the internal non-determinism is important to guarantee that the branching time properties of components are not lost when the entire system is obtained. The basic ideas come from the work of Fiadeiro and Maibaum where notions from category theory are used to structure logical specifications. As the work of Fiadeiro and Maibaum is stated in a linear temporal logic, here we investigate how to extend these notions to a branching time logic, which can be used to reason about systems where non-determinism is present. To illustrate the practical applications of these ideas, we introduce deontic operators in our logic and we show that the modularization of specifications also allows designers to maintain the encapsulation of deontic prescriptions; this is in particular useful to reason about fault-tolerant systems, as we demonstrate with a small example.},

We construct two second-order iterative monads: one, called the second-order rational monad, SH, is proved to be the initial second-order iterative monad. The other one, called the context-free monad, CH, is a quotient of SH and in the original case of a polynomial endofunctor H of Set we prove that CH is the monad studied by B. Courcelle.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {Dividing the world into subsystems is an important component of the scientific method. The choice of subsystems, however, is not defined a priori. Typically, it is dictated by our experimental capabilities, and, in general, different agents may have different capabilities. Here we propose a construction that associates every agent with a subsystem, equipped with its set of states and its set of transformations. In quantum theory, this construction accommodates the traditional notion of subsystems as factors of a tensor product, as well as the notion of classical subsystems of quantum systems. We then restrict our attention to systems where all physical transformations act invertibly. For such systems, the future states are a faithful encoding of the past states, in agreement with a requirement known as the Conservation of Information. For systems satisfying the Conservation of Information, we propose a dynamical definition of pure states, and show that all the states of all subsystems admit a canonical purification. This result extends the purification principle to a broader setting, in which coherent superpositions can be interpreted as purifications of incoherent mixtures. As an example, we illustrate the general construction for subsystems associated with group representations.},

abstract = {Differential privacy offers a way to answer queries about sensitive information while providing strong, provable privacy guarantees, ensuring that the presence or absence of a single individual in the database has a negligible statistical effect on the query's result. Proving that a given query has this property involves establishing a bound on the query's sensitivity---how much its result can change when a single record is added or removed. A variety of tools have been developed for certifying that a given query differentially private. In one approach, Reed and Pierce [34] proposed a functional programming language, Fuzz, for writing differentially private queries. Fuzz uses linear types to track sensitivity and a probability monad to express randomized computation; it guarantees that any program with a certain type is differentially private. Fuzz can successfully verify many useful queries. However, it fails when the sensitivity analysis depends on values that are not known statically. We present DFuzz, an extension of Fuzz with a combination of linear indexed types and lightweight dependent types. This combination allows a richer sensitivity analysis that is able to certify a larger class of queries as differentially private, including ones whose sensitivity depends on runtime information. As in Fuzz, the differential privacy guarantee follows directly from the soundness theorem of the type system. We demonstrate the enhanced expressivity of DFuzz by certifying differential privacy for a broad class of iterative algorithms that could not be typed previously.},

The well-known mismatch between these two notions for what concerns the morphisms is resolved by extending the coalgebraic framework by lax cohomomorphisms. Enriching both labeled transition systems and coalgebras with algebraic structure for an algebraic specification, the correspondence is lost again. This leads to the introduction of lax coalgebras, where the coalgebra structure is given by a lax homomorphism. The resulting category of lax coalgebras and lax cohomomorphisms for a suitable endofunctor is shown to be isomorphic to the category of structured transition systems, where both states and transitions form algebras. The framework is also presented on a more abstract categorical level using monads and comonads, extending the bialgebraic approach recently introduced by Turi and Plotkin. {\textcopyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In the first part of the paper we recall the coalgebraic approach to handling the so-called invisible transitions that appear in different state-based systems semantics. We claim that these transitions are always part of the unit of a certain monad. Hence, coalgebras with internal moves are exactly coalgebras over a monadic type. The rest of the paper is devoted to supporting our claim by studying two important behavioural equivalences for state-based systems with internal moves, namely: weak bisimulation and trace semantics. We continue our research on weak bisimulations for coalgebras over order enriched monads. The key notions used in this paper and proposed by us in our previous work are the notions of an order saturation monad and a saturator. A saturator operator can be intuitively understood as a reflexive, transitive closure operator. There are two approaches towards defining saturators for coalgebras with internal moves. Here, we give necessary conditions for them to yield the same notion of weak bisimulation. Finally, we propose a definition of trace semantics for coalgebras with silent moves via a uniform fixed point operator. We compare strong and weak bisimilation together with trace semantics for coalgebras with internal steps.},

@article{Ellerman2014,
abstract = {Classical logic is usually interpreted as the logic of propositions. But from Boole's original development up to modern categorical logic, there has always been the alternative interpretation of classical logic as the logic of subsets of any given (nonempty) universe set. Partitions on a universe set are dual to subsets of a universe set in the sense of the reverse-the-arrows category-theoretic duality--which is reflected in the duality between quotient objects and subobjects throughout algebra. Hence the idea arises of a dual logic of partitions. That dual logic is described here. Partition logic is at the same mathematical level as subset logic since models for both are constructed from (partitions on or subsets of) arbitrary unstructured sets with no ordering relations, compatibility or accessibility relations, or topologies on the sets.\r\nJust as Boole developed logical finite probability theory as a quantitative treatment of subset logic, applying the analogous mathematical steps to partition logic yields a logical notion of entropy so that information theory can be refounded on partition logic. But the biggest application is that when partition logic and the accompanying logical information theory are "lifted" to complex vector spaces, then the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is obtained. Partition logic models indefiniteness (i.e., numerical attributes on a set become more definite as the inverse-image partition becomes more refined) while subset logic models the definiteness of classical physics (an entity either definitely has a property or definitely does not). Hence partition logic provides the backstory so the old idea of "objective indefiniteness" in QM can be fleshed out to a full interpretation of quantum mechanics.},

Such a high-level implementation is useful since it supports the ranking of any object, it allows for the reasoning across structured and unstructured data, and it gives the software (knowledge) engineer control over ranking and thus supports customisation. The contributions of this paper include the specification of probabilistic SQL (PSQL) and probabilistic relational algebra (PRA), a new relational operator for probability estimation (the relational Bayes), the probabilistic relational modelling of retrieval models, a comparison of modelling retrieval with traditional SQL versus modelling retrieval with PSQL, and a comparison of the performance of probability estimation with traditional SQL versus PSQL. The main findings are that the PSQL/PRA paradigm allows for the description of advanced retrieval models, is suitable for solving large-scale retrieval tasks, and outperforms traditional SQL in terms of abstraction and performance regarding probability estimation.},

It has a natural generalisation to a probabilistic bisimilarity pseudometric, whose definition involves the Kantorovich metric on probability distributions. The pseudometric has discounted and undiscounted variants, according to whether one discounts the future in observing discrepancies between states. This paper is concerned with the complexity of computing probabilistic bisimilarity and the probabilistic bisimilarity pseudometric on labelled Markov chains. We show that the problem of computing probabilistic bisimilarity is P -hard by reduction from the monotone circuit value problem. We also show that the discounted pseudometric is rational and can be computed exactly in polynomial time using the network simplex algorithm and the continued fraction algorithm. In the undiscounted case we show that the pseudometric is again rational and can be computed exactly in polynomial time using the ellipsoid algorithm. Finally, using the notion of couplings on Markov chains, we show that the pseudometric can be used to compute bounds on the variational distance of trace distributions, which is NP -hard to compute directly.},

Pervasiveness of these formalisms allows us to exploit existing algorithms in: searching for a simulation, and hence verifying quantitative correctness that is formulated as language inclusion. Transformations of automata that aid search for simulations are introduced, too. This verification workflow is implemented for the plus-times and max-plus semirings.

abstract = {In this chapter I present a process algebraic approach to the modelling of security properties and policies. I will concentrate on the concept of secrecy, also known as confidentiality, and in particular on the notion of non-interference. Non-interference seeks to characterise the absence of information flows through a system and, as such, is a fundamental concept in information security. A central thesis of these lectures is that, viewed from a process algebraic point of view, the problem of characterising non-interference is essentially equivalent to that of characterising the equivalence of processes. The latter is itself a fundamental and delicate question at the heart of process algebra and indeed theoretical computer science: the semantics of a process is intimately linked to the question of which processes should be regarded as equivalent. We start, by way of motivation and to set the context, with a brief historical background. A much fuller exposition of security policies in the wider sense, embracing properties other than secrecy, can be found in the chapter by Pierangela Samarati in this volume. We then cover some elements of process algebra, in particular CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes), that we need and present a formulation of noninterference, along with some more operational presentations of process algebra, including the idea of bi-simulation. I argue that the classical notion of unwinding found in the security literature is really just bisimulation in another guise. Finally, I propose some generalisations of the process algebraic formulations designed to encompass a richer class of policies and examples.},

Research has shown that even from seemingly harmless sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, or magnetometers) an ever expanding set of potentially sensitive user behavior can be inferred. Providing robust anonymity assurances is a principal mechanism for protecting users when data is shared (e.g., with medical professionals or friends). In this paper, we study the feasibility of user de-anonymization from mobile sensor datasets routinely collected on commodity devices (e.g., smartphones). We perform a systematic investigation to quantify the threat of de-anonymization using existing sparsity-based techniques adapted to exploit mobile sensor data characteristics. This preliminary study indicates significant threats to user anonymity exist within shared mobile sensor data and further investigation is warranted.},

abstract = {Worldwide, there has been a rapid growth in interest in rough set theory and its applications in recent years. Evidence of this can be found in the increasing number of high-quality articles on rough sets and related topics that have been published in a variety of international journals, symposia, workshops, and international conferences in recent years. In addition, many international workshops and conferences have included special sessions on the theory and applications of rough sets in their programs. Rough set theory has led to many interesting applications and extensions. It seems that the rough set approach is fundamentally important in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, especially in research areas such as machine learning, intelligent systems, inductive reasoning, pattern recognition, mereology, knowledge discovery, decision analysis, and expert systems. In the article, we present the basic concepts of rough set theory and point out some rough set-based research directions and applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B{\"{u}}chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable ($\Pi$11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.},

abstract = {Informally, an obfuscator O is an (efficient, probabilistic) " compiler " that takes as input a program (or circuit) P and produces a new program O(P) that has the same functionality as P yet is " unintel-ligible " in some sense. Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide vari-ety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the " unintelligibility " condition in obfuscation as mean-ing that O(P) is a " virtual black box, " in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given O(P), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to P . In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above in-tuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of functions F that are inherently unobfuscatable in the following sense: there is a property $\pi$ : F → {0, 1} such that (a) given any program that computes a function f ∈ F, the value $\pi$(f) can be efficiently computed, yet (b) given oracle access to a (randomly selected) function f ∈ F, no efficient algorithm can compute $\pi$(f) much better than random guessing. We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (TC 0). We also rule out several potential applications of obfuscators, by constructing " unob-fuscatable " signature schemes, encryption schemes, and pseudorandom function families.},

This universe is characterized as a metric completion of the hereditarily finite sets; as a Stone space arising as the solution of a functorial fixed-point equation involving the Vietoris construction; as the Stone dual of the free modal algebra; and as the subspace of maximal elements of a domain equation involving the Plotkin (or convex) powerdomain. These results illustrate the methods developed in the author's 'Domain theory in logical form', and related literature, and have been taken up in recent work on topological coalgebras. The set-theoretic universe of finitary sets also supports an interesting form of set theory. It contains non-well founded sets and a universal set; and is closed under positive versions of the usual axioms of set theory.},

abstract = {Folds over inductive datatypes are well understood and widely used. In their plain form, they are quite restricted; but many disparate generalisations have been proposed that enjoy similar calculational benefits. There have also been attempts to unify the various generalisations: two prominent such unifications are the 'recursion schemes from comonads' of Uustalu, Vene and Pardo, and our own 'adjoint folds'. Until now, these two unified schemes have appeared incompatible. We show that this appearance is illusory: in fact, adjoint folds subsume recursion schemes from comonads. The proof of this claim involves standard constructions in category theory that are nevertheless not well known in functional programming: Eilenberg-Moore categories and bialgebras.},

However, as soon as one adds a self-referencing construct, like hybrid logic's down-arrow binder, to the basic modal language, decidability is lost, even if one restricts binding to a single variable. Here, we concentrate on the latter case and investigate the logics obtained by restricting the nesting depth of modalities between binding and use. In particular, for distances strictly below 3 we obtain well-behaved logics with a relatively high descriptive power. We investigate the fragment with distance 1 in the framework of coalgebraic modal logic, for which we provide very general decidability and complexity results. For the fragment with distance 2 we focus on the case of Kripke semantics and obtain optimum complexity bounds (no harder than the base logic). We show that this fragment is expressive enough to accommodate the guarded fragment over the correspondence language.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Our main results provide sufficient criteria for the validity of such principles: in the presence of comprehension, the induction principle for initial algebras is admissible, and dually, in the presence of quotient types, the coinduction principle for terminal coalgebras is admissible. After giving an alternative formulation of induction in terms of binary relations, we combine both principles and obtain a mixed induction/coinduction principle which allows us to reason about minimal solutionsX≅$\sigma$(X) whereXmay occur both positively and negatively in the type constructor $\sigma$. We further strengthen these logical principles to deal with contexts and prove that such strengthening is valid when the (abstract) logic we consider is contextually/functionally complete. All the main results follow from a basic result about adjunctions between “categories of algebras” (inserters).},

abstract = {Differential privacy formalises privacy-preserving mechanisms that provide access to a database. We pose the question of whether Bayesian inference itself can be used directly to provide private access to data, with no modification. The answer is affirmative: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can be used to achieve a desired level of privacy and utility. To do so, we generalise differential privacy to arbitrary dataset metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular datasets. We prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which gives a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility and on the distinguishability of datasets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds. All our general results hold for arbitrary database metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions.},

The main concept which underlies the issues above is that of fibration, which gives an abstract presentation of the indexing present in all cases: predicates indexed by types/contexts in first-order logic and types indexed by kinds in polymorphic calculi. The characterisation of the logical concepts in terms of fibrations relies on a fundamental property of adjunctions between fibrations, which in particular relates some structure in the total category of a fibration with that of the fibres. Suitable instances of this property reflect the above-mentioned logical concepts in an abstract way, independently of their syntactic presentation, thereby illuminating their main features.},

Here, this class will be called the class of iteration theories. Also, there is a close connection between Elgot's iterative theories and iteration theories. In this paper we introduce algebras for iteration theories, called iteration algebras. Iteration algebras are natural generalization of regular algebras and they are closely related to iterative algebras as well. It is shown that the absolutely free iteration algebras are the algebras of regular trees. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Compositionality and process equivalence are both standard concepts of process algebra. Compositionality means that the behaviour of a compound system relies only on the behaviour of its components, i.e. there is no emergent behaviour. Process equivalence means that the explicit statespace of a system takes a back seat to its interaction patterns: the information that an environment can obtain though interaction. Petri nets are a classical, yet widely used and understood, model of concurrency. Nevertheless, they have often been described as a non-compositional model, and tools tend to deal with monolithic, globally-specified models. This tutorial paper concentrates on Petri Nets with Boundaries (PNB): a compositional, graphical algebra of 1-safe nets, and its applications to reachability checking within the tool Penrose. The algorithms feature the use of compositionality and process equivalence, a powerful combination that can be harnessed to improve the performance of checking reachability and coverability in several common examples where Petri nets model realistic concurrent systems.},

Such definitions give rise to questions of lazy corecursive derivations and parallelism, as execution of such logic programs can have both recursive and corecursive features at once. Observational and coalgebraic semantics have been used to study them abstractly. The programming developments have often occurred separately and have usually been implementation-led. Here, we give a coherent semantics-led account of the issues, starting with abstract category theoretic semantics, developing coalgebra to characterise naturally arising trees, and proceeding towards implementation of a new dialect, CoALP, of logic programming, characterised by guarded lazy corecursion and parallelism.},

abstract = {We propose a new specification framework for information hiding properties such as anonymity and privacy. The framework is based on the concept of a function view, which is a concise representation of the attacker's partial knowledge about a function. We describe system behavior as a set of functions, and formalize different information hiding properties in terms of views of these functions. We present an ex- tensive case study, in which we use the function view framework to systematically classify and rigorously define a rich domain of identity-related properties, and to demonstrate that privacy and anonymity are independent. The key feature of our approach is its modularity. It yields precise, formal specifications of information hiding properties for any protocol formalism and any choice of the attacker model as long as the latter induce an observational equivalence relation on protocol instances. In particular, specifications based on function views are suitable for any cryptographic process calculus that defines some form of indistin- guishability between processes. Our definitions of information hiding properties take into account any feature of the security model, including probabilities, random number generation, timing, etc., to the ex- tent that it is accounted for by the formalism in which the system is specified.},

That formula was, in the case of ideal monads, also used by Ghani and Uustalu. We deduce that coproduct embeddings of consistent monads are injective; and that a coproduct of injective monad morphisms is injective. Two consistent monads have a coproduct iff either they have arbitrarily large common fixpoints, or one is an exception monad, possibly modified to preserve the empty set. Hence a consistent monad has a coproduct with every monad iff it is an exception monad, possibly modified to preserve the empty set. We also show other fixpoint results, including that a functor (not constant on nonempty sets) is finitary iff every sufficiently large cardinal is a fixpoint.},

Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds of knowledge about the data. In this article, we show that knowledge of the mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular, all known mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this article, we introduce a model called m-confidentiality which deals with minimality attacks, and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments show that minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm can prevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.},

abstract = {We consider a statistical database in which a trusted administrator introduces noise to the query responses with the goal of maintaining privacy of individual database entries. In such a database, a query consists of a pair (S, f) where S is a set of rows in the database and f is a function mapping database rows to {0, 1}. The true answer is $\Sigma$i$\epsilon$S f(di), and a noisy version is released as the response to the query. Results of Dinur, Dwork, and Nissim show that a strong form of privacy can be maintained using a surprisingly small amount of noise -- much less than the sampling error -- provided the total number of queries is sublinear in the number of database rows. We call this query and (slightly) noisy reply the SuLQ (Sub-Linear Queries) primitive. The assumption of sublinearity becomes reasonable as databases grow increasingly large.We extend this work in two ways. First, we modify the privacy analysis to real-valued functions f and arbitrary row types, as a consequence greatly improving the bounds on noise required for privacy. Second, we examine the computational power of the SuLQ primitive. We show that it is very powerful indeed, in that slightly noisy versions of the following computations can be carried out with very few invocations of the primitive: principal component analysis, k means clustering, the Perceptron Algorithm, the ID3 algorithm, and (apparently!) all algorithms that operate in the in the statistical query learning model [11].},

The first result of the paper shows that the commutative identity is implied by the Conway identities and the Scott induction principle formulated to involve only equations. Since the Scott induction principle holds in free iteration theories, we obtain a relatively simple first order axiomatization of the equational properties of iteration theories. We show, by means of an example that a simplified version of the Scott induction principle does not suffice for this purpose: There exists a Conway theory satisfying the scalar Scott induction principle which is not an iteration theory. A second example shows that there exists an iteration theory satisfying the scalar version of the Scott induction principle in which the general form fails. Finally, an example is included to verify the expected fact that there exists an iteration theory violating the scalar Scott induction principle. Interestingly, two of these examples are ordered theories in which the iteration operation is defined via least pre-fixed points. ?? 2000.},

abstract = {The notion of iteratively defined functions from and to heterogeneous term algebras is introduced as the solution of a finite set of equations of a special shape. Such a notion has remarkable consequences: (1) Choosing the second-order typed lamdda-calculus ($\Lambda$ for short) as a programming language enables one to represent algebra elements and iterative functions by automatic uniform synthesis paradigms, using neither conditional nor recursive constructs. (2) A completeness theorem for $\Lambda$-terms with type of degree at most two and a companion corollary for $\Lambda$-programs have been proved. (3) A new congruence relation for the last-mentioned $\Lambda$-terms which is stronger than $\Lambda$-convertibility is introduced and proved to have the meaning of a $\Lambda$-program equivalence. Moreover, an extension of the paradigms to the synthesis of functions of higher complexity is considered and exemplified. All the concepts are explained and motivated by examples over integers, list- and tree-structures. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

Information comes in pieces, and it should be possible to aggregate these pieces. Finally, it should be possible to extract that part of a piece of information which relates to a given question. Modeling these concepts leads to an algebraic theory of information. This theory centers around two different but closely related types of information algebras, each containing operations for aggregation or combination of information and for extracting information relevant to a given question. Generic constructions of instances of such algebras are presented. In particular, the close connection of information algebras to logic and domain theory will be exhibited.},

abstract = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs' commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

abstract = {It is not uncommon in the data anonymization literature to oppose the "old" k-anonymity model to the "new" differential privacy model, which offers more robust privacy guarantees. Yet, it is often disregarded that the utility of the anonymized results provided by differential privacy is quite limited, due to the amount of noise that needs to be added to the output, or because utility can only be guaranteed for a restricted type of queries. This is in contrast with k-anonymity mechanisms, which make no assumptions on the uses of anonymized data while focusing on preserving data utility from a general perspective. In this paper, we show that a synergy between differential privacy and {Mathematical expression}-anonymity can be found: {Mathematical expression}-anonymity can help improving the utility of differentially private responses to arbitrary queries. We devote special attention to the utility improvement of differentially private published data sets. Specifically, we show that the amount of noise required to fulfill {Mathematical expression}-differential privacy can be reduced if noise is added to a {Mathematical expression}-anonymous version of the data set, where {Mathematical expression}-anonymity is reached through a specially designed microaggregation of all attributes. As a result of noise reduction, the general analytical utility of the anonymized output is increased. The theoretical benefits of our proposal are illustrated in a practical setting with an empirical evaluation on three data sets.},

abstract = {The basic idea behind information algebras is that information comes in pieces, each referring to a certain question, that these pieces can be combined or aggregated and that the part relating to a given question can be extracted. This algebraic structure can be given different forms. Questions were originally represented by subsets of variables. Pieces of information were then represented by valuations associated with the domains of variables. This leads to an algebraic structure called valuation algebras. The basic axiomatics of this algebraic structure was in essence proposed by Shenoy and Shafer. Here a much more general view of systems of questions is proposed and pieces of information are related to the elements of this system of questions. This leads to a new and extended system of axioms for information algebras. Classical valuation algebras are essentially a special case of this new system. A full discussion of the algebraic theory of this new information algebras is given, including local computation, duality between labeled and domain-free versions of the algebras, order of information, finiteness of information and approximation, compact and continuous information algebras. Finally a rather complete discussion of uncertain information, based on random maps into information algebras is presented. This is shown to represent a generalisation of classical Dempster-Shafer theory.},

abstract = {Random sets can be considered as random variables with values in a Boolean algebra, in particular in a field of sets. Many properties of random sets, in particular those relative to belief functions, can also be obtained by relaxing the algebraic structure of the domain. In fact, functions monotone to order ∞, like Choquet capacities, can be defined on semilattices. In this paper random variables with values in some kind of graded semilattices are studied. It is shown that this algebraic structure models important operations regarding information. It turns out that random variables in this algebra form themselves an algebra of the same kind. Their probability distribution corresponds to functions monotone of order ∞ or to belief functions in the sense of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. This paper proposes therefore a natural generalization of evidence theory to a general structure related to probabilistic argumentation systems. Those systems have many interesting models like probabilistic assumption-based reasoning with different kind of logics, systems of linear equations and inequalities with stochastic disturbances, etc. The theory presented leads thus to an interesting and novel way of combining logic and probability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It provides a succinct categorical interface to most of them, free of their diverse implementation details, using the ideas and structures that in the meantime emerged from research in semantics of computation and programming. The salient feature of the language of monoidal categories is that it is supported by a sound and complete graphical formalism, string diagrams, which provide a concrete and intuitive interface for abstract reasoning about computation. The original motivation and the ultimate goal of this effort is to provide a convenient high level programming language for a theory of computational resources, such as one-way functions, and trapdoor functions, by adopting the methods for hiding the low level implementation details that emerged from practice.},

abstract = {There is a huge number of problems, from various areas, being solved by reducing them to SAT. However, for most applications, translations into SAT are performed by specialized, problem-specific tools. In this paper we describe a novel approach for uniform solving of a wide class of problems by reducing them to SAT. The approach uses a new specification language that combines imperative and declarative programming paradigms. A problem is specified by a test (expressed in an imperative form) that a given set of values indeed makes a solution to the problem. In the solving phase, parameters of the problem are represented by (finite) vectors of propositional formulae and the specification is symbolically executed. An assertion that given values make a solution is transformed to an instance of the SAT problem and passed to a SAT solver. If the formula is satisfiable, its model is transformed back to variables describing the problem, i.e., to a solution of the problem. We also describe a system URSA that implements the described approach. The experiments show that the system is competitive to state-of-the related modelling systems.},

abstract = {Turi and Plotkin gave a precise mathematical formulation of a notion of structural operational semantics in their paper “Towards a mathematical operational semantics.” Starting from that definition and at the level of generality of that definition, we give a mathematical formulation of some of the basic constructions one makes with structural operational semantics. In particular, given a single-step operational semantics, as is the spirit of their work, one composes transitions and considers streams of transitions in order to study the dynamics induced by the operational semantics. In all their leading examples, it is obvious that one can do that and it is obvious how to do it. But if their definition is to be taken seriously, one needs to be able to make such constructions at the level of generality of their definition rather than case-by-case. So this paper does so for several of the basic constructions associated with structural operational semantics, in particular those required in order to speak of a stream of transitions and hence of dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper uses category theory to provide a formal mathematical framework for specifying and integrating relational database schemas; it builds on the work of Buneman et al. [2], who develop a domain-theoretic version of relational database theory. We generalize their setting in the following way: we let a schema be a functor V from a category L of attribute names to the category of domains; this reflects the fact that attributes may take values of different types, and that there may be functional constraints between attributes. As an application, we show how the process of schema integration and the resolution of conflicts between schemas may be carried out in a mathematically rigorous setting, using simple concepts from category theory; this proposal is shown to be consistent with the way in which queries on a federated database are processed (by `distributing' them among its component databases).},

We present a new class of iteration theories derived from final coalgebras.

All of the work can be done using finality properties and equational reasoning. Having a semantics, we obtain the following completeness result: the equations involving fixed-point terms which are valid for final coalgebra interpretations are exactly those valid in a number of contexts pertaining to recursion. For example, they coincide with the equations valid for least-fixed point recursion on cpo's. ??1999 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.},

We show that all these four statements are somewhat wrong. In fact, a careful calculation shows that ``Hartley's rule'' in fact coincides with Shannon's formula.

abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95% of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

In this paper, we propose structural logical relations as a technique for conducting these proofs in systems with limited meta-logical strength by explicitly representing and reasoning about an auxiliary logic.

Standard $\mu$-algebras are complete meaning that their lattice reduct is a complete lattice. We prove that any nontrivial quasivariety of $\mu$-algebras contains a $\mu$-algebra that has no embedding into a complete $\mu$-algebra. We then focus on modal $\mu$-algebras, i.e. algebraic models of the propositional modal $\mu$-calculus. We prove that free modal $\mu$-algebras satisfy a condition-reminiscent of Whitman's condition for free lattices-which allows us to prove that (i) modal operators are adjoints on free modal $\mu$-algebras, (ii) least prefixed points of $\Sigma$1-operations satisfy the constructive relation $\mu$x . f = {n-ary logical or}n ≥ 0 fn (⊥). These properties imply the following statement: the MacNeille-Dedekind completion of a free modal$\mu$ -algebra is a complete modal$\mu$ -algebra and moreover the canonical embedding preserves all the operations in the classComp ($\Sigma$1, $\Pi$1) of the fixed point alternation hierarchy. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These systems can capture a large class of timed transition systems, including systems with uncountably many states and uncountable nondeterminism. In this paper a behavioural pseudometric is introduced for metric labelled transition systems. The behavioural distance between states, a nonnegative real number, captures the similarity of the behaviour of those states. The smaller the distance, the more alike the states are. In particular, the distance between states is 0 iff they are bisimilar. Three different characterisations of this pseudometric are given: a fixed point, a logical and a coinductive characterisation. These generalise the fixed point, logical and coinductive characterisations of bisimilarity. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

This commit-ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

This book offers a more balanced introduction for graduate students that describes the various approaches, their strengths and weaknesses, and when they are best used. Milner's CCS and its operational semantics are introduced, together with notions of behavioural equivalence based on bisimulation techniques and with variants of Hennessy-Milner modal logics.

The book has arisen from various courses taught in Iceland and Denmark and is designed to give students a broad introduction to the area, with exercises throughout.},

Our main result generalises a construction of Kracht and Wolter and confirms that completeness transfers to fusion for a large class of logics over coalgebraic semantics.

We show that discrete countable Lawvere V-theories allow us to model all the leading examples of computational effects other than continuations, and that they are closed under constructions of sum, tensor and distributive tensor, which are the fundamental ways in which one combines such effects.

As with Cox's Theorem, our requirements imply that the extended logic must be isomorphic to (finite-set) probability theory.

Driven bymutual benefits, or by regu- lations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about in- dividuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing reliesmainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communi- ties, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in prac- tical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions},

The second section reviews the light thrown on aspects of representation theory by the machinery of monoidal category theory, such as braidings and convolution. The category theory of Mackey functors is reviewed in the third section. Some recent material and a conjecture concerning monoidal centres is included. The fourth and final section looks at ways in which monoidal categories are, and might, be used for new invariants of low-dimensional manifolds and for the field theory of theoretical physics.},

abstract = {Checking two probabilistic automata for equivalence has been shown to be a key problem for efficiently establishing various behavioural and anonymity properties of probabilistic systems. In recent experiments a randomised equivalence test based on polynomial identity testing outperformed deterministic algorithms. In this paper we show that polynomial identity testing yields efficient algorithms for various generalisations of the equivalence problem. First, we provide a randomized NC procedure that also outputs a counterexample trace in case of inequivalence. Second, we show how to check for equivalence two probabilistic automata with (cumulative) rewards. Our algorithm runs in deterministic polynomial time, if the number of reward counters is fixed. Finally we show that the equivalence problem for probabilistic visibly pushdown automata is logspace equivalent to the Arithmetic Circuit Identity Testing problem, which is to decide whether a polynomial represented by an arithmetic circuit is identically zero.},

Previously surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches, and categories them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000–2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches center around three distinct categories namely: design-time (28%), run-time (32%) and auditing (10%). Also, organisational and internal control based compliance management frameworks (21%) and hybrid approaches make (9%) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the compliance problem.},

In this paper we describe a generalisation of the theory of canonical extension to the setting of first order logic. We define a notion of canonical extension for coherent categories. These are the categorical analogues of distributive lattices and they provide categorical semantics for coherent logic, the fragment of first order logic in the connectives ???, ???, 0, 1 and ???. We describe a universal property of our construction and show that it generalises the existing notion of canonical extension for distributive lattices. Our new construction for coherent categories has led us to an alternative description of the topos of types, introduced by Makkai (1981) in [22]. This allows us to give new and transparent proofs of some properties of the action of the topos of types construction on morphisms. Furthermore, we prove a new result relating, for a coherent category C, its topos of types to its category of models (in Set). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Algebraic effect handlers are a powerful means for describing effectful computations. They provide a lightweight and orthogonal technique to define and compose the syntax and semantics of different effects. The semantics is captured by handlers, which are functions that transform syntax trees. Unfortunately, the approach does not support syntax for scoping constructs, which arise in a number of scenarios. While handlers can be used to provide a limited form of scope, we demonstrate that this approach constrains the possible interactions of effects and rules out some desired semantics. This paper presents two different ways to capture scoped constructs in syntax, and shows how to achieve different semantics by reordering handlers. The first approach expresses scopes using the existing algebraic handlers framework, but has some limitations. The problem is fully solved in the second approach where we introduce higher-order syntax.},

abstract = {In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. ERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in $V$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category.

Given information about the database, a description of sensitive data, and assumptions about users' prior knowledge, our goal is to determine if answering a past user's query could have led to a privacy breach. According to our definition, an audited property A is private, given the disclosure of property B, if no user can gain confidence in A by learning B, subject to prior knowledge constraints. Privacy is not violated if the disclosure of B causes a loss of confidence in A. The new notion of privacy is formalized using the well-known semantics for reasoning about knowledge, where logical properties correspond to sets of possible worlds (databases) that satisfy these properties. Database users are modelled as either possibilistic agents whose knowledge is a set of possible worlds, or as probabilistic agents whose knowledge is a probability distribution on possible worlds. We analyze the new privacy notion, show its relationship with the conventional approach, and derive criteria that allow the auditor to test privacy efficiently in some important cases. In particular, we prove characterization theorems for the possibilistic case, and study in depth the probabilistic case under the assumption that all database records are considered a-priori independent by the user, as well as under more relaxed (or absent) prior-knowledge assumptions. In the probabilistic case we show that for certain families of distributions there is no efficient algorithm to test whether an audited property A is private given the disclosure of a property B, assuming P NP. Nevertheless, for many interesting families, such as the family of product distributions, we obtain algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in practice.},

abstract = {The spectral gap -- the difference in energy between the ground state and the first excited state -- is one of the most important properties of a quantum many-body system. Quantum phase transitions occur when the spectral gap vanishes and the system becomes critical. Much of physics is concerned with understanding the phase diagrams of quantum systems, and some of the most challenging and long-standing open problems in theoretical physics concern the spectral gap, such as the Haldane conjecture that the Heisenberg chain is gapped for integer spin, proving existence of a gapped topological spin liquid phase, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture (one of the Millennium Prize problems). These problems are all particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: Given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is the system it describes gapped or gapless? Here we show that this problem is undecidable, in the same sense as the Halting Problem was proven to be undecidable by Turing. A consequence of this is that the spectral gap of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians is not determined by the axioms of mathematics, much as Goedels incompleteness theorem implies that certain theorems are mathematically unprovable. We extend these results to prove undecidability of other low temperature properties, such as correlation functions. The proof hinges on simple quantum many-body models that exhibit highly unusual physics in the thermodynamic limit.},

Many applications, though, provide contexts with quantitative information, telling not justwhether an object satisfies an attribute, but also quantifying this satisfaction. Contexts in this form arise as rating matrices in recommender systems, as occurrence matrices in text analysis, as pixel intensitymatrices in digital image processing, etc. Such applications have attracted a lot of attention, and several numeric extensions of FCA have been proposed. We propose the framework of proximity sets (proxets), which subsume partially ordered sets (posets) as well as metric spaces. One feature of this approach is that it extracts from quantified contexts quantified concepts, and thus allows full use of the available information. Another feature is that the categorical approach allows analyzing any universal properties that the classical FCA and the new versions may have, and thus provides structural guidance for aligning and combining the approaches.},

abstract = {Deciding whether one probability distribution is more informative (in the sense of representing a less indeterminate situation) than another one is typically done using well-established information measures such as, e.g., the Shannon entropy or other dispersion indices. In contrast, the relative specificity of possibility distributions is evaluated by means of fuzzy set inclusion. In this paper, we propose a technique for comparing probability distributions from the point of view of their relative dispersion without resorting to a numerical index. A natural partial ordering in terms of relative "peakedness" of probability functions is proposed which is closely related to order-1 stochastic dominance. There is also a close connection between this ordering on probability distributions and the standard specificity ordering on possibility distributions that can be derived by means of a known probability-possibility transformation. The paper proposes a direct proof showing that the (total) preordering on probability measures defined by probabilistic entropy refines the (partial) ordering defined by possibilistic specificity. This result, also valid for other dispersion indices, is discussed against the background of related work in statistics, mathematics (inequalities on convex functions), and the social sciences. Finally, an application of the possibilistic specificity ordering in the field of machine learning or, more specifically, the induction of decision forests is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Data types are undergoing a major leap forward in their sophistication driven by a conjunction of i) theoretical advances in the foundations of data types; and ii) requirements of programmers for ever more control of the data structures they work with. In this paper we develop a theory of indexed data types where, crucially, the indices are generated inductively at the same time as the data. In order to avoid commitment to any specific notion of indexing we take an axiomatic approach to such data types using fibrations - thus giving us a theory of what we call fibred data types. The genesis of these fibred data types can be traced within the literature, most notably to Dybjer and Setzer's introduction of the concept of induction-recursion. This paper, while drawing heavily on their seminal work for inspiration, gives a categorical reformulation of Dybjer and Setzer's original work which leads to a large number of extensions of induction-recursion. Concretely, the paper provides i) conceptual clarity as to what inductionrecursion fundamentally is about; ii) greater expressiveness in allowing not just the inductive-recursive definition of families of sets, or even indexed families of sets, but rather the inductiverecursive definition of a whole host of other structures; iii) a semantics for induction-recursion based not on the specific model of families, but rather an axiomatic model based upon fibrations which therefore encompasses diverse structures (domain theoretic, realisability, games etc) arising in the semantics of programming languages; and iv) technical justification as to why these fibred data types exist using large cardinals from set theory.},

abstract = {Abstract. Many applications benefit from user location data, but lo- cation data raises privacy concerns. Anonymization can protect privacy, but identities can sometimes be inferred from supposedly anonymous data. This paper studies a new attack on the anonymity of location data. We show that if the approximate locations of an individual's home and workplace can both be deduced from a location trace, then the median size of the individual's anonymity set in the U.S. working population is 1, 21 and 34,980, for locations known at the granularity of a census block, census track and county respectively. The location data of people who live and work in different regions can be re-identified even more easily. Our results show that the threat of re-identification for location data is much greater when the individual's home and work locations can both be deduced from the data. To preserve anonymity, we offer guidance for obfuscating location traces before they are disclosed.},

We show that morphisms of schemas induce three data migration functors, which translate instances from one schema to the other in canonical ways. These functors parameterize projections, unions, and joins over all tables simultaneously and can be used in place of conjunctive and disjunctive queries. We also show how to connect a database and a functional programming language by introducing a functorial connection between the schema and the category of types for that language. We begin the paper with a multitude of examples to motivate the definitions, and near the end we provide a dictionary whereby one can translate database concepts into category-theoretic concepts and vice versa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

@incollection{Dinesh2008,
abstract = {We consider the problem of checking whether the operations of an organization conform to a body of regulation. The immediate motivation comes from the analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations that apply to bloodbanks - organizations that collect, process, store, and use donations of blood and blood components. Statements in such regulations convey constraints on operations or sequences of operations that are performed by an organization. It is natural to express these constraints in a temporal logic. There are two important features of regulatory texts that need to be accommodated by a representation in logic. First, the constraints conveyed by regulation can be obligatory (required) or permitted (optional). Second, statements in regulation refer to others for conditions or exceptions. An organization conforms to a body of regulation if and only if it satisfies all the obligations. However, permissions provide exceptions to obligations, indirectly affecting conformance. In this paper, we extend linear temporal logic to distinguish between obligations and permissions, and to allow statements to refer to others. While the resulting logic allows for a direct representation of regulation, evaluating references between statements has high complexity. We discuss an empirically motivated assumption that lets us replace references with tests of lower complexity, leading to efficient trace-checking algorithms in practice.},

This generalizes Johnstone's construction of the Vietoris powerlocale, in the sense that his construction is obtained by taking for $\T$ the finite covariant power set functor. Our construction of the $\T$-powerlocale $\VT \bbL$ out of a frame $\bbL$ is based on ideas from coalgebraic logic and makes explicit the connection between the Vietoris construction and Moss's coalgebraic cover modality. We show how to extend certain natural transformations between set functors to natural transformations between $\T$-powerlocale functors. Finally, we prove that the operation $\VT$ preserves some properties of frames, such as regularity, zero-dimensionality, and the combination of zero-dimensionality and compactness.},

These are coalgebras for a functor F⋅S with F as an endofunctor on the category of analytic spaces, and S is the subprobability functor. The modal operators are generalized through predicate liftings which are set-valued natural transformations involving the functor. Two states are equivalent iff they cannot be separated by a formula. This equivalence relation is used to construct a cospan for logical equivalent coalgebras under a separation condition for the set of predicate liftings. Consequently, behavioral and logical equivalence are really the same. From the cospan we construct a span. The central argument is a selection argument giving us the dynamics of a mediating coalgebra from the domains of the cospan. This construction is used to establish that behavioral equivalent coalgebras are bisimilar, yielding the equivalence of all three characterizations of a coalgebra's behavior as in the case of Kripke models or Markov transition systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we will show how purely categorical constructions of terms are advantageous when investigating situations concerning uncertainty; more specifically where uncertainty comes from and how uncertainty is integrated when dealing with terms over selected signatures. There are basically two ways of invoking uncertainty for terms. On one hand, we may proceed by building composed monads where uncertainty is provided by some suitable monad composed with the traditional term monad. On the other hand, we can provide a strictly formal basis for term monads being created over categories themselves carrying uncertainty. This is the distinction between 'computing with fuzzy' and 'fuzzy computing' and the fundamental question raised by these constructions is where uncertainty resides in language constructions for logic. This paper also shows how the notion of signature often needs to be expanded to levels of signatures, in particular when dealing with type constructors. Such levels allow us to strictly delineate, e.g., primitive operations, type terms, and value level terms. Levels of signature will in this paper be exemplified by the construction of the signature of simply typed lambda calculus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptographic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or ‘altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison.},

abstract = {The powerset construction is a standard method for converting a nondeterministic automaton into a deterministic one recognizing the same language. In this paper, we lift the powerset construction from automata to the more general framework of coalgebras with structured state spaces. Coalgebra is an abstract framework for the uniform study of different kinds of dynamical systems. An endofunctor F determines both the type of systems (F-coalgebras) and a notion of behavioural equivalence ($\sim$_F) amongst them. Many types of transition systems and their equivalences can be captured by a functor F. For example, for deterministic automata the derived equivalence is language equivalence, while for non-deterministic automata it is ordinary bisimilarity. We give several examples of applications of our generalized determinization construction, including partial Mealy machines, (structured) Moore automata, Rabin probabilistic automata, and, somewhat surprisingly, even pushdown automata. To further witness the generality of the approach we show how to characterize coalgebraically several equivalences which have been object of interest in the concurrency community, such as failure or ready semantics.},

abstract = {Privacy is an increasingly important aspect of data publishing. Reasoning about privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant is the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background knowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels such as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how one can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of auxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of current anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations independently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We investigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent anonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models of limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can breach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques. The class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more positive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as differential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use of arbitrary side information.This resistance enables ``stand-alone'' design of anonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other releases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an important class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the property. This significantly enlarges the class of protocols known to enable modular design.},

This article is a tutorial on two key aspects of the fold operator for lists. First of all, we emphasize the use of the universal property of fold both as a proof principle that avoids the need for inductive proofs, and as a definition principle that guides the transformation of recursive functions into definitions using fold. Secondly, we show that even though the pattern of recursion encapsulated by fold is simple, in a language with tuples and functions as first-class values the fold operator has greater expressive power than might first be expected.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for constructing linear secret sharing schemes (LSSS) from linear error correcting codes and linear universal hash functions in a blackbox way. The main advantage of this new construction is that the privacy property of the resulting secret sharing scheme essentially becomes independent of the code we use, only depending on its rate. This allows us to fully harness the algorithmic properties of recent code constructions such as efficient encoding and decoding or efficient list-decoding. Choosing the error correcting codes and universal hash functions involved carefully, we obtain solutions to the following open problems: – A linear near-threshold secret sharing scheme with both linear time sharing and reconstruction algorithms and large secrets (i.e. secrets of size $\Omega$(n)). Thus, the computational overhead per shared bit in this scheme is constant. – An efficiently reconstructible robust secret sharing scheme for n/3 ≤ t < (1−){\textperiodcentered}n/2 corrupted players (for any constant > 0) with shares of optimal size O(1 + $\lambda$/n) and secrets of size $\Omega$(n + $\lambda$), where $\lambda$ is the security parameter.},

abstract = {Modal logic has a good claim to being the logic of choice for describing the reactive behaviour of systems modeled as coalgebras. Logics with modal operators obtained from so-called predicate liftings have been shown to be invariant under behavioral equivalence. Expressivity results stating that, conversely, logically indistinguishable states are behaviorally equivalent depend on the existence of separating sets of predicate liftings for the signature functor at hand. Here, we provide a classification result for predicate liftings which leads to an easy criterion for the existence of such separating sets, and we give simple examples of functors that fail to admit expressive normal or monotone modal logics, respectively, or in fact an expressive (unary) modal logic at all. We then move on to polyadic modal logic, where modal operators may take more than one argument formula. We show that every accessible functor admits an expressive polyadic modal logic. Moreover, expressive polyadic modal logics are, unlike unary modal logics, compositional.},

It can be regarded as the category-theoretic version of the classical area of algebraic semantics. The overall assumptions needed are small indeed: working only in categories with "enough final coalgebras" we show how to formulate, solve, and study recursive program schemes. Our general theory is algebraic and so avoids using ordered, or metric structures. Our work generalizes the previous approaches which do use this extra structure by isolating the key concepts needed to study substitution in infinite trees, including second-order substitution. As special cases of our interpreted solutions we obtain the usual denotational semantics using complete partial orders, and the one using complete metric spaces. Our theory also encompasses implicitly defined objects which are not usually taken to be related to recursive program schemes. For example, the classical Cantor two-thirds set falls out as an interpreted solution (in our sense) of a recursive program scheme.},

Despite recent work on implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been adequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated verification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main technical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of probabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a probabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is intended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to apply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it to show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our differential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating our proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a restricted class of relations from the proof technique.},

abstract = {Personal data has value to both its owner and to institutions who would like to analyze it. Privacy mechanisms protect the owner's data while releasing to analysts noisy versions of aggregate query results. But such strict protections of individual's data have not yet found wide use in practice. Instead, Internet companies, for example, commonly provide free services in return for valuable sensitive information from users, which they exploit and sometimes sell to third parties. As the awareness of the value of the personal data in- creases, so has the drive to compensate the end user for her private information. The idea of monetizing private data can improve over the narrower view of hiding private data, since it empowers individuals to control their data through financial means. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for as- signing prices to noisy query answers, as a function of their accuracy, and for dividing the price amongst data owners who deserve compensation for their loss of privacy. Our framework adopts and extends key principles from both dif- ferential privacy and query pricing in data markets. We identify essential properties of the price function and micro- payments, and characterize valid solutions.},

We contribute generalization of fair simulation in two different directions: one for nondeterministic tree automata (this has been studied previously by Bomhard); and the other for probabilistic word automata (with a finite state space), both under the Buechi acceptance condition. The former (nondeterministic) definition is formulated in terms of systems of fixed-point equations, hence is readily translated to parity games and then amenable to Jurdzinski's algorithm; the latter (probabilistic) definition bears a strong ranking-function flavor.

Previous observations by Hermida and Jacobs identify coinductive predicates as suitable final coalgebras in a fibration - a categorical abstraction of predicate logic. In this paper we follow the spirit of a seminal work by Worrell and study final sequences in a fibration. Our main contribution is to identify some categorical "size restriction" axioms that guarantee stabilization of final sequences after ?? steps. In its course we develop a relevant categorical infrastructure that relates fibrations and locally presentable categories, a combination that does not seem to be studied a lot. The genericity of our fibrational framework can be exploited for: binary relations (i.e. the logic of "binary predicates") for which a coinductive predicate is bisimilarity; constructive logics (where interests are growing in coinductive predicates); and logics for name-passing processes. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Markov transition systems model probabilistic systems in which the transition among states is represented by prob- abilistic laws. Stochastic relations lie at the mathematical heart of Markov transition systems. We show in this paper that a stochastic relation can be decomposed along a given congruence so that the parts are bisimilar (with the original relation as a mediat- ing component); this result is the bisimulation analogue to the classical decomposition of algebras through complementary congruences. We apply this technique also to Kripke models for modal logics.},

Our path-based temporal logics are interpreted over coalgebras of endofunctors obtained as the composition of a computation type (e.g. non-deterministic or stochastic) with a general transition type. The semantics of such logics relies on the existence of execution maps similar to the trace maps introduced by Jacobs and co-authors as part of the coalgebraic theory of finite traces (Hasuo et al., 2007 [1]). We consider finite execution maps derived from the theory of finite traces, and a new notion of maximal execution map that accounts for maximal, possibly infinite executions.

This is as natural and transparent a language for higher category theory as the language of sheaves is for algebraic geometry, or vector spaces for linear algebra. It is introduced carefully, then used to give simple descriptions of a variety of higher categorical structures. In particular, one possible definition of n-category is discussed in detail, and some common aspects of other possible definitions are established. Many examples are given throughout.

abstract = {Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical aspects of programming concepts, but if we want to understand how programming concepts evolve, how programmers think and talk about them and how they are used in practice, we need to consider a broader perspective that includes historical, philosophical and cognitive aspects. In this paper, we develop such broader understanding of monads, a programming concept that has an infamous formal definition, syntactic support in several programming languages and a reputation for being elegant and powerful, but also intimidating and difficult to grasp. This paper is not a monad tutorial. It will not tell you what a monad is. Instead, it helps you understand how computer scientists and programmers talk about monads and why they do so. To answer these questions, we review the history of monads in the context of programming and study the development through the perspectives of philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics and cognitive sciences. More generally, we present a framework for understanding programming concepts that considers them at three levels: formal, metaphorical and implementation. We base such observations on established results about the scientific method and mathematical entities -- cognitive sciences suggest that the metaphors used when thinking about monads are more important than widely accepted, while philosophy of science explains how the research paradigm from which monads originate influences and restricts their use. Finally, we provide evidence for why a broader philosophical, sociological look at programming concepts should be of interest for programmers. It lets us understand programming concepts better and, fundamentally, choose more appropriate abstractions as illustrated in number of case studies that conclude the paper.},

abstract = {In the context of formal verification in general and model checking in particular, parity games serve as a mighty vehicle: many problems are encoded as parity games, which are then solved by the seminal algorithm by Jurdzinski. In this paper we identify the essence of this workflow to be the notion of progress measure, and formalize it in general, possibly infinitary, lattice-theoretic terms. Our view on progress measures is that they are to nested/alternating fixed points what invariants are to safety/greatest fixed points, and what ranking functions are to liveness/least fixed points. That is, progress measures are combination of the latter two notions (invariant and ranking function) that have been extensively studied in the context of (program) verification. We then apply our theory of progress measures to a general model-checking framework, where systems are categorically presented as coalgebras. The framework's theoretical robustness is witnessed by a smooth transfer from the branching-time setting to the linear-time one. Although the framework can be used to derive some decision procedures for finite settings, we also expect the proposed framework to form a basis for sound proof methods for some undecidable/infinitary problems.},

abstract = {We propose a simple approach to combining first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single representation. A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

We clarify the sense in which codensity monads act as substitutes for monads induced by adjunctions. We also expand on an undeservedly ignored theorem of Kennison and Gildenhuys: that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite sets) into (sets) is the ultrafilter monad. This result is analogous to the correspondence between measures and integrals. So, for example, we can speak of integration against an ultrafilter. Using this language, we show that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is double dualization. From this it follows that compact Hausdorff spaces have a linear analogue: linearly compact vector spaces. Extension of this analogy to other theories is left as an open question.},

It is formulated in simply typed $\lambda$-calculus extended with names that can be restricted to a lexical scope, tested for equality, explicitly swapped and abstracted. The new recursion principle is motivated by the nominal sets notion of ‘$\alpha$-structural recursion', whose use of names and associated freshness side-conditions in recursive definitions formalizes common practice with binders. The new calculus has a simple interpretation in nominal sets equipped with name-restriction operations. It is shown to adequately represent $\alpha$-structural recursion while avoiding the need to verify freshness side-conditions in definitions and computations. The paper is a revised and expanded version of Pitts (Nominal System T. In Proceedings of the 37th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL 2010 (Madrid, Spain).

Instead it only uses predicative, i.e., strictly positive inductive definitions on the metalevel. To achieve this we show that every strictly positive operator on types gives rise to an operator on saturated sets which is not only monotone but also (deterministically) set based - a concept introduced by Peter Aczel in the context of intuitionistic set theory. We also extend this to coinductive types using greatest fixpoints of strictly monotone operators on the metalevel. The use of the term interleaving for this situation is due to Ralph Matthes, e.g., see [Mat98]. An alternative would be mutually.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the {\em status quo} for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.},

A programmer can use these logics to safely ascertain whether one term is behaviorally equivalent to another or to determine the value of a lazy program. However, neither of the existing calculi models evaluation in a way that matches lazy implementations. Both calculi suffer from the same two problems. First, the calculi never discard function calls, even after they are completely resolved. Second, the calculi include re-association axioms even though these axioms are merely administrative steps with no counterpart in any implementation. In this paper, we present an alternative axiomatization of lazy evaluation using a single axiom. It eliminates both the function call retention problem and the extraneous re-association axioms. Our axiom uses a grammar of contexts to describe the exact notion of a needed computation. Like its predecessors, our new calculus satisfies consistency and standardization properties and is thus suitable for reasoning about behavioral equivalence. In addition, we establish a correspondence between our semantics and Launchbury's natural semantics.},

Indeed, the restricted syntax of CTL limits its expressive power and many important behaviors (e.g., strong fairness) can not be specified in CTL. On the other hand, while model checking for CTL can be done in time that is linear in the size of the specification, it takes time that is exponential in the specification for LTL.

abstract = {Many problems of artificial intelligence, or more generally, many problems of information processing, have a generic solution based on local computation on join trees or acyclic hypertrees. There are several variants of this method all based on the algebraic structure of valuation algebras. A strong requirement underlying this approach is that the elements of a problem decomposition form a join tree. Although it is always possible to construct covering join trees, if the requirement is originally not satisfied, it is not always possible or not efficient to extend the elements of the decomposition to the covering join tree. Therefore in this paper different variants of an axiomatic framework of valuation algebras are introduced which prove sufficient for local computation without the need of an extension of the factors of a decomposition. This framework covers the axiomatic system proposed by Shenoy and Shafer (1990) [1]. A particular emphasis is laid on the important special cases of idempotent algebras and algebras with some notion of division. It is shown that all well-known architectures for local computation like the Shenoy-Shafer architecture, Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter and HUGIN architectures may be adapted to this new framework. Further a new architecture for idempotent algebras is presented. As examples, in addition to the classical instances of valuation algebras, semiring-based valuation algebras, Gaussian potentials and the relational algebra are presented. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {GADTs are at the cutting edge of functional programming and become more widely used every day. Nevertheless, the semantic foundations underlying GADTs are not well understood. In this paper we solve this problem by showing that the standard theory of data types as carriers of initial algebras of functors can be extended from algebraic and nested data types to GADTs. We then use this observation to derive an initial algebra semantics for GADTs, thus ensuring that all of the accumulated knowledge about initial algebras can be brought to bear on them. Next, we use our initial algebra semantics for GADTs to derive expressive and principled tools - analogous to the well-known and widely-used ones for algebraic and nested data types - for reasoning about, programming with, and improving the performance of programs involving, GADTs; we christen such a collection of tools for a GADT an initial algebra package. Along the way, we give a constructive demonstration that every GADT can be reduced to one which uses only the equality GADT and existential quantification. Although other such reductions exist in the literature, ours is entirely local, is independent of any particular syntactic presentation of GADTs, and can be implemented in the host language, rather than existing solely as a metatheoretical artifact. The main technical ideas underlying our approach are (i) to modify the notion of a higher-order functor so that GADTs can be seen as carriers of initial algebras of higher-order functors, and (ii) to use left Kan extensions to trade arbitrary GADTs for simpler-but-equivalent ones for which initial algebra semantics can be derived.

abstract = {The object-capability model is an increasingly popular architecture\nfor building secure software systems. This model promotes the construction\nof reusable patterns for enforcing security properties within object-capability\nsystems. In this thesis, we apply the process algebra CSP, and its\nautomatic refinement-checker FDR, to analyse object-capability patterns\nand prove whether they uphold the security properties they are designed\nto enforce. We show how CSP can accurately model object capability\nsystems and patterns, and express their wide variety of features.\nWe show that complex safety properties of object-capability patterns\ncan be reasoned about by encoding them as CSP refinement checks for\nFDR. This enables one to detect vulnerabilities automatically in\npatterns due to concurrent and recursive invocation. We show that\nCSP's theory of data-independence can be applied to allow one to\ngeneralise the results obtained from analysing small fixed-sized\nsystems, to systems of arbitrary size. We show how to reason about\nthe information flow properties of object capability patterns. We\nargue that in order to do so sensibly, one must make the assumption\nthat objects can directly in uence each other only through their\novert interactions together. We show how traditional noninterference\nproperties can be adapted to take this assumption into account, and\nhow they can then be tested with FDR. We consider how to reason about\nliveness properties of object-capability patterns under necessary\nfairness assumptions. We prove that such properties cannot always\nbe expressed as CSP refinement checks for FDR, making them impossible\nfor FDR to test precisely, but how FDR can be applied to reason about\nthem by testing sufficient conditions for them instead. To reason\nabout authority, we develop a framework for expressing general non-causation\nproperties and show how it can capture various kinds of authority,\nas well as the notions of defensive correctness and defensive con-\nsistency. We show that, for deterministic systems, non-causation\nof safety effects can be expressed as refinement checks in CSP models\nthat FDR can support. However, for nondeterministic systems, we prove\nthat even certain simple non-causation properties cannot be precisely\ncaptured this way.},

The normalization barrier stems from a theorem in computability theory that says that a to- tal universal function for the total computable functions is impossible. In this paper we break through the normaliza- tion barrier and define a self-interpreter for System F$\omega$, a strongly normalizing $\lambda$-calculus. After a careful analysis of the classical theorem, we show that static type checking in F$\omega$ can exclude the proof's diagonalization gadget, leaving open the possibility for a self-interpreter. Along with the self-interpreter, we program four other operations in F$\omega$, in- cluding a continuation-passing style transformation.

abstract = {Deep learning draws upon many modeling formalisms that researchers can use to guide their design efforts and describe their algorithms. One of these formalisms is the idea of structured probabilistic models. We have already discussed structured probabilistic models briefly in Chapter 3.14. That brief presentation was sufficient to understand how to use structured probabilistic models as a language to describe some of the algorithms in part II of this book. Now, in part III, structured probabilistic models are a key ingredient of many of the most important research topics in deep learning. In order to prepare to discuss these research ideas, this chapter describes structured probabilistic models in much greater detail. This chapter is intended to be self-contained; the reader does not need to review the earlier introduction before continuing with this chapter. A structured probabilistic model is a way of describing a probability distribu-tion, using a graph to describe which random variables in the probability distri-bution interact with each other directly. Here we use " graph " in the graph theory sense–a set of vertices connected to one another by a set of edges. Because the structure of the model is defined by a graph, these models are often also referred to as graphical models. The graphical models research community is large and has developed many different models, training algorithms, and inference algorithms. In this chap-ter, we provide basic background on some of the most central ideas of graphical models, with an emphasis on the concepts that have proven most useful to the deep learning research community. If you already have a strong background in graphical models, you may wish to skip most of this chapter. However, even a graphical model expert may benefit from reading the final section of this chap-ter, section 13.6, in which we highlight some of the unique ways that graphical 412 CHAPTER 13. STRUCTURED PROBABILISTIC MODELS FOR DEEP LEARNING models are used for deep learning algorithms. Deep learning practitioners tend to use very different model structures, learning algorithms, and inference procedures than are commonly used by the rest of the graphical models research community. In this chapter, we identify these differences in preferences and explain the reasons for them. In this chapter we first describe the challenges of building large-scale proba-bilistic models in section 13.1. Next, we describe how to use a graph to describe the structure of a probability distribution in section 13.2. We then revisit the challenges we described in section 13.1 and show how the structured approach to probabilistic modeling can overcome these challenges in section 13.3. One of the major difficulties in graphical modeling is understanding which variables need to be able to interact directly, i.e., which graph structures are most suitable for a given problem. We outline two approaches to resolving this difficulty by learning about the dependencies in section 13.4. Finally, we close with a discussion of the unique emphasis that deep learning practitioners place on specific approaches to graphical modeling in section 13.6. 13.1 The Challenge of Unstructured Modeling},

abstract = {The notion of context in functional languages no longer refers just to variables in scope. Context can capture additional properties of variables (usage patterns in linear logics; caching requirements in dataflow languages) as well as additional resources or properties of the execution environment (rebindable resources; platform version in a cross-platform application). The recently introduced notion of coeffects captures the latter, whole-context properties, but it failed to capture fine-grained per-variable properties. We remedy this by developing a generalized coeffect system with annotations indexed by a coeffect shape. By instantiating a concrete shape, our system captures previously studied flat (whole-context) coeffects, but also structural (per-variable) coeffects, making coeffect analyses more useful. We show that the structural system enjoys desirable syntactic properties and we give a categorical semantics using extended notions of indexed comonad. The examples presented in this paper are based on analysis of established language features (liveness, linear logics, dataflow, dynamic scoping) and we argue that such context-aware properties will also be useful for future development of languages for increasingly heterogeneous and distributed platforms.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

abstract = {Sifted colimits (those that commute with finite products in sets) play a major role in categorical universal algebra. For example, varieties of (many-sorted) algebras are precisely the free cocompletions under sifted colimits of (many-sorted) Lawvere theories. Such a characterisation does not depend on the existence of finite products in algebraic theories, but on the above fact that these products commute with sifted colimits and another condition: finite products form a sound class of limits. In this paper we study the notion of soundness for general classes of weights in enriched category theory. We show that soundness of a given class of weights is equivalent to having a `nice' characterisation of flat weights for that class. As an application, we give an elementary characterisation of sifted weights for the enrichment in categories and in preorders. We also provide a number of examples of sifted weights using our elementary criterion.},

We illustrate the usefulness of this technique by using it to attack a popular data sanitization scheme known as Anatomy. We stress that Anatomy is not the only sanitization scheme that is vulnerable to this attack. In fact, any scheme that uses the random worlds model, i.i.d. model, or tuple-independent model needs to be re-evaluated. The difference between the attack presented here and others that have been proposedin the past is that we do not need extensive background knowledge. An attacker only needs to know the nonsensitive attributes of one individual in the data, and can carry out this attack just by building a machine learning model over the sanitized data. The reason this attack is successful is that it exploits a subtle flaw in the way prior work computed the probability of disclosure of a sensitive attribute. We demonstrate this theoretically, empirically, and with intuitive examples. We also discuss how this generalizes to many other privacy schemes.},

abstract = {We give a coalgebraic formulation of timed processes and their operational semantics. We model time by a monoid called a “time domain”, and we model processes by “timed transition systems”, which amount to partial monoid actions of the time domain or, equivalently, coalgebras for an “evolution comonad” generated by the time domain. All our examples of time domains satisfy a partial closure property, yielding a distributive law of a monad for total monoid actions over the evolution comonad, and hence a distributive law of the evolution comonad over a dual comonad for total monoid actions. We show that the induced coalgebras are exactly timed transition systems with delay operators. We then integrate our coalgebraic formulation of time qua timed transition systems into Turi and Plotkin's formulation of structural operational semantics in terms of distributive laws. We combine timing with action via the more general study of the combination of two arbitrary sorts of behaviour whose operational semantics may interact. We give a modular account of the operational semantics for a combination induced by that of each of its components. Our study necessitates the investigation of products of comonads. In particular, we characterise when a monad lifts to the category of coalgebras for a product comonad, providing constructions with which one can readily calculate.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to relate algebraic quantum mechanics to topos theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces. Motivated by Bohr's idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from S(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized) truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).},

Murthy [Murthy, C.R., Classical proofs as programs: How, what and why, Technical Report TR 91-1215, Cornell University, Department of Computer Science (1991)] outlined an extension of this result to classical logic, with the double-negation rule mapped to Felleisen's control operator C [Felleisen, M., D. Friedman, E. Kohlbecker and B. Duba, A syntactic theory of sequential control, Theoretical Computer Science 52 (1987), pp. 205-237]. Since C is similar to call/cc operator in Scheme and SML/NJ, this opens a possibility of extracting programs in these languages from classical proofs. However, even though the basic idea has appeared in the literature, there appears to be little work that uses Griffin's extension of the Curry-Howard isomorphism to extract practical programs in real programming languages. In this article, we fill in missing steps in Murthy's argument and extend his method to encompass more interesting proofs by allowing additional ubiquitous inference rules: equality rules, rules for atomic formulas (such as transitivity of {less-than or slanted equal to}), and rules for pairs of dual decidable atoms (such as {less-than or slanted equal to} and >). We illustrate the usefulness of this extension with a complete example of program extraction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Since a pomset is a string in which the total order has been relaxed to be a partial order, in this paper we view them as a generalization of strings, and investigate their algebraic properties. In particular, we investigate the axiomatic properties of pomsets, sets of pomsets and ideals of pomsets, under such operations as concatenation, parallel composition, union and their associated closure operations. We find that the equational theory of sets, pomsets under concatenation, parallel composition and union is finitely axiomatizable, whereas the theory of languages under the analogous operations is not. A similar result is obtained for ideals of pomsets, which incorporate the notion of subsumption which is also known as augmentation. Finally, we show that the addition of any closure operation (parallel or serial) leads to nonfinite axiomatizability of the resulting equational theory. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

This provides a richer family of meaningful partial descriptions than are available in the convex powerdomain and also makes it possible to include the empty set in a satisfactory way. The new construct is given a rigorous mathematical treatment like that which has been applied to the known powerdomains. It is proved that M is a continuous functor on bifinite domains which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from a category of continuous structures called mix algebras. For a domain D with a coherent Scott topology, elements of MD can be represented as pairs (U, V) where U ⊆ D is a compact upper set, V ⊆ D is a closed set and the downward closure of U {frown} V is equal to V.

The target application for this work is a mapping program that shows the commuting patterns of the population of the United States. The source data for this application were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, but due to privacy constraints, they cannot be used directly by the mapping program. Instead, we generate synthetic data that statistically mimic the original data while providing privacy guarantees. We use these synthetic data as a surrogate for the original data. We find that while some existing definitions of privacy are inapplicable to our target application, others are too conservative and render the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are very unlikely. Moreover, the data in our target application is sparse, and none of the existing solutions are tailored to anonymize sparse data. In this paper, we propose solutions to address the above issues.},

abstract = {Traditionally in categorical logic predicates on an object/type X are represented as subobjects of X. Here we break with that tradition and use maps of the form p : X --> X + X with [id, id] o p = id as predicates. This new view gives a more dynamic, measurement-oriented view on predicates, that works well especially in a quantitative setting. In classical logic (in the category of sets) these new predicates coincide with the traditional ones (subsets, or characteristic maps X --> {0,1}); in probabilistic logic (in the category of sets and stochastic matrices), the new predicates correspond to fuzzy predicates X --> [0,1]; and in quantum logic (in Hilbert spaces) they correspond to effects (positive endomaps below the identity), which may be understood as fuzzy predicates on a changed basis. It is shown that, under certain conditions about coproducts +, predicates p : X --> X + X form effect algebras and carry a scalar multiplication (with probabilities). Suitable substitution functors give rise to indexed/fibred categories. In the quantum case the famous Born rule - describing the probability of observation outcomes - follows directly from the form of these substitution functors: probability calculation becomes substitution in predicate logic. Moreover, the characteristic maps associated with predicates provide tests in a dynamic logic, and turn out to capture measurement in a form that uniformly covers the classical, probabilistic and quantum case. The probabilities incorporated in predicates (as eigenvalues) serves as weights for the possible measurement outcomes.},

abstract = {The model checking of higher-order recursion schemes has important applications in the verification of higher-order programs. Ong has previously shown that the modal mu-calculus model checking of trees generated by order-n recursion scheme is n-EXPTIME complete, but his algorithm and its correctness proof were rather complex. We give an alternative, type-based verification method: Given a modal mu-calculus formula, we can construct a type system in which a recursion scheme is typable if, and only if, the (possibly infinite, ranked) tree generated by the scheme satisfies the formula. The model checking problem is thus reduced to a type checking problem. Our type-based approach yields a simple verification algorithm, and its correctness proof (constructed without recourse to game semantics) is comparatively easy to understand. Furthermore, the algorithm is polynomial-time in the size of the recursion scheme, assuming that the formula and the largest order and arity of non-terminals of the recursion scheme are fixed.},

We formalize some aspects of contextual in- tegrity in a logical framework for expressing and reasoning about norms of transmission of personal information. In comparison with access control and privacy policy frame- works such as RBAC, EPAL, and P3P, these norms focus on who personal information is about, how it is transmit- ted, and past and future actions by both the subject and the users of the information. Norms can be positive or neg- ative depending on whether they refer to actions that are allowed or disallowed. Our model is expressive enough to capture naturally many notions of privacy found in legisla- tion, including those found in HIPAA, COPPA, and GLBA. A number of important problems regarding compliance with privacy norms, future requirements associated with specific actions, and relations between policies and legal standards reduce to standard decision procedures for temporal logic.},

abstract = {The analysis of multiple datasets on users' behaviors opens interesting information fusion possibilities and, at the same time, creates a potential for re-identification and de-anonymization of users' data. On the one hand, this kind of approaches can breach users' privacy despite anonymization. On the other hand, combining different datasets is a key enabler for advanced context-awareness in that information from multiple sources can complement and enrich each other. In this work we analyze different anonymized mobility datasets in the direction of highlighting re-identification and information fusion possibilities. In particular we focus on call detail record (CDR) datasets released by mobile telecom operators and datasets comprising geo-localized messages released by social network sites. Results shows that: (1) in line with previous findings, few (about 4) data points are enough to uniquely pin point the majority (90 %) of the users, (2) more than 20 % of CDR users have a single social network user exhibiting a number of matching data points. We speculate that these two users might be the same person. (3) We derive an estimate of the probability of two users begin the same person given the number of data points they have in common, and estimate that for 3 % of the social network users we can find a CDR user very likely (>90 % probability) to be the same person.},

abstract = {The task of {\em data fusion} is to identify the true values of data items (eg, the true date of birth for {\em Tom Cruise}) among multiple observed values drawn from different sources (eg, Web sites) of varying (and unknown) reliability. A recent survey\cite{LDL+12} has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods on Deep Web data. In this paper, we study the applicability and limitations of different fusion techniques on a more challenging problem: {\em knowledge fusion}. Knowledge fusion identifies true subject-predicate-object triples extracted by multiple information extractors from multiple information sources. These extractors perform the tasks of entity linkage and schema alignment, thus introducing an additional source of noise that is quite different from that traditionally considered in the data fusion literature, which only focuses on factual errors in the original sources. We adapt state-of-the-art data fusion techniques and apply them to a knowledge base with 1.6B unique knowledge triples extracted by 12 extractors from over 1B Web pages, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the data sets used in previous data fusion papers. We show great promise of the data fusion approaches in solving the knowledge fusion problem, and suggest interesting research directions through a detailed error analysis of the methods.},

abstract = {This paper is a tutorial on defining recursive descent parsers in Haskell. In the spirit of one-stop shopping, the paper combines material from three areas into a single source. The three areas are functional parsers (Burge, 1975; Wadler, 1985; Hutton, 1992; Fokker, 1995), the use of monads to structure functional programs (Wadler, 1990, 1992a, 1992b), and the use of special syntax for monadic programs in Haskell (Jones, 1995; Peterson et al., 1996). More specifically, the paper shows how to define monadic parsers using do notation in Haskell. Of course, recursive descent parsers defined by hand lack the efficiency of bottom-up parsers generated by machine (Aho et al., 1986; Mogensen, 1993; Gill and Marlow, 1995). However, for many research applications, a simple recursive descent parser is perfectly sufficient. Moreover, while parser generators typically offer a fixed set of combinators for describing grammars, the method described here is completely extensible: parsers are first-class values, and we have the full power of Haskell available to define new combinators for special applications. The method is also an excellent illustration of the elegance of functional programming.},

It is well-known that Set-coalgebras are not semantically adequate for finitary modal logics in the sense that bisimilarity does not in general coincide with logical equivalence. Stone-coalgebras (coalgebras over the category of Stone spaces), on the other hand, do provide an adequate semantics for finitary modal logics. This leads us to study the relationship of finitary modal logics and Set-coalgebras by uncovering the relationship between Set-coalgebras and Stone-coalgebras. This builds on a long tradition in modal logic, where one studies canonical extensions of modal algebras and ultrafilter extensions of Kripke frames to account for finitary logics. Our main contributions are the generalisations of two classical theorems in modal logic to coalgebras, namely the J{\'{o}}nsson-Tarski theorem giving a set-theoretic representation for each modal algebra and the bisimulation-somewhere-else theorem stating that two states of a coalgebra have the same (finitary modal) theory iff they are bisimilar (or behaviourally equivalent) in the ultrafilter extension of the coalgebra.},

@phdthesis{Green2009,
abstract = {In 2006 America Online's research division leaked the web search histories of more than 600,000 of their customers. While this data had been stripped of customer names and identifying information, it nevertheless revealed deeply private information about these individuals' identities and interests. Access to information is becoming fundamental to our society, whether it is a web search or a look at one's health records. While much research has considered the problem of securing data within the database, there exist applications where the content of the users' queries is more sensitive. For example, a doctor who queries a medical records database may inadvertently reveal information that can harm his patient's interests (e.g., queries by a disease specialist might indicate a potential infection, and thus impact insurance coverage decisions). In this work we propose privacy-preserving databases in which a central database serves a pool of users without learning their query pattern. These systems will have several competing requirements. First, we require that the database operator learn nothing about which items the user is asking for, or even the user's identity. This guarantee must hold according to a strong security definition that takes into account the possibility of a malicious operator who tampers with the protocol. Secondly, we require that the database operator retain the ability to control access to items within the database. This seems quite challenging, however, since access control appears to be fundamentally incompatible with our desired privacy requirements. A promising technology for constructing oblivious databases is Oblivious Transfer (OT). In a k -out-of-N OT protocol, a Sender with a collection of N messages interacts with a Receiver such that the Receiver obtains any k of the messages, and no information about the rest of the database. For its part, the Sender learns nothing about which messages the Receiver requested. Unfortunately, while a k -items-out-of- N policy can be considered a basic form access control, it is not powerful enough for many practical applications. Furthermore, many existing OT constructions are vulnerable to selective-failure attacks that may effectively compromise user privacy if undertaken by a malicious database operator. In this work we propose several methods that address these problems efficiently and under strong definitions of security. We will then show how these techniques may be combined in order to produce a complete solution. Specifically, we propose: (1) Two new protocols for k -out-of- N Oblivious Transfer (OT) based on techniques from the field of Identity Based Encryption (IBE). Proposed by Shamir [Sha84] and realized by Boneh-Franklin [BF01], IBE is a powerful technology that greatly simplifies key distribution. We formalize the notion of using this system to blindly extract keys, and show how the primitive can be used to construct efficient fully-simulatable OT protocols (previous OT constructions are either inefficient, are proven according to unrealistic security definitions, or require strong complexity assumptions). (2) A third OT protocol that is secure in the strong Universal Composability (UC) model of Canetti [Can01]. Not only does this protocol meet a strong definition of security, but it can be generically composed with any other UC-secure protocol (including itself). This is important in the case of databases where many users may concurrently access the same database. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient adaptive OT construction to meet this definition. (3) A technique for providing strong and history-dependent access control for an oblivious database. In this model, the user is prevented from requesting items that are not permitted by her policy, while the database operator learns nothing more about the content of her requests. Our constructions are based on a new form of stateful anonymous credentials. Finally, we show how these technologies can be combined to produce a practical oblivious database. The contributions of this work are both theoretical and practical. In particular, we believe that the notion of constructing Oblivious Transfer from Identity-Based Encryption may ultimately help to expand our understanding of both primitives. Simultaneously, the constructions we propose achieve high efficiency under strong security definitions. Ultimately, we believe that this is the first work to thoroughly consider the practical tradeoffs of constructing privacy-preserving databases.},

abstract = {Weighted finite automata are classical nondeterministic finite automata in which the transitions carry weights. These weights may model, for example, the cost involved when executing a transition, the resources or time needed for this, or the probability or reliability of its successful execution. Weights can also be added to classical automata with infinite state sets like pushdown automata, and this extension constitutes the general concept of weighted automata. Since their introduction in the 1960s they have stimulated research in related areas of theoretical computer science, including formal language theory, algebra, logic, and discrete structures. Moreover, weighted automata and weighted context-free grammars have found application in natural-language processing, speech recognition, and digital image compression.This book covers all the main aspects of weighted automata and formal power series methods, ranging from theory to applications. The contributors are the leading experts in their respective areas, and each chapter presents a detailed survey of the state of the art and pointers to future research. The chapters in Part I cover the foundations of the theory of weighted automata, specifically addressing semirings, power series, and fixed point theory. Part II investigates different concepts of weighted recognizability. Part III examines alternative types of weighted automata and various discrete structures other than words. Finally, Part IV deals with applications of weighted automata, including digital image compression, fuzzy languages, model checking, and natural-language processing.Computer scientists and mathematicians will find this book an excellent survey and reference volume, and it will also be a valuable resource for students exploring this exciting research area.},

In this work, we apply this concept to metric spaces to study a mechanism that randomizes a deterministic query by adding mean-zero noise to keep differential privacy. For one-shot queries, we show that privacy of an n-dimensional input implies a lower bound n − n ln(on the entropy of the randomized output, and this lower bound is achieved by adding Laplacian noise. We then consider the privacy of a discrete-time linear feedback system in which noise is added to the system output at each time. The adversary estimates the system states from the output history. We show that, to keep the system differentially private, the output entropy is bounded below, and this lower bound is achieves by an explicit mechanism.},

The conditional probabilities are induced by a map together with a predicate (the condition). The latter is a predicate in the logic of effect modules on this Kleisli category. This same approach can be transferred to the category of C*-algebras (with positive unital maps), whose predicate logic is also expressed in terms of effect modules. Conditional probabilities can again be expressed via a triangle-fill-in property. In the literature, there are several proposals for what quantum conditional probability should be, and also there are extra difficulties not present in the classical case. At this stage, we only describe quantum systems with classical parameterization.},

A stumbling block for reuse is that inductive definitions and proofs are closed to extension. This is a manifestation of the expression problem that has been addressed by the Meta-Theory {\`{a}} la Carte (MTC) framework in the context of programming language meta-theory. However, MTC's use of extensible Church-encodings is unsatisfactory. This paper takes a better approach to the problem with datatype-generic programming (DGP). It applies well-known DGP techniques to represent modular datatypes, to build functions from functor algebras with folds and to compose proofs from proof algebras by means of induction. Moreover, for certain functionality and proofs our approach can achieve more reuse than MTC: instead of composing modular components we provide a single generic definition once and for all.},

Using this compactness we show that the set of labelled transition systems that refine a modal transition system, its ''set of implementations'', is compact and derive a compactness theorem for Hennessy-Milner logic on such implementation sets. These results extend to systems that also have partially specified state propositions, unify existing denotational, operational, and metric semantics on partial processes, render robust consistency measures for modal transition systems, and yield an abstract interpretation of compact sets of labelled transition systems as Scott-closed sets of modal transition systems.},

There have been several illustrations of the application of Laplace noise addition for count data, but no evaluation of its performance for numeric data. In this study we evaluate the privacy and utility performance of Laplace noise addition for numeric data. Our results indicate that Laplace noise addition delivers the promised level of privacy only by adding a large quantity of noise for even relatively large sub-sets. Because of this, even for simple mean queries, the responses for a masking mecha-nism that uses Laplace noise addition is of little value. We also show that Laplace noise addition may be vulnerable to a tracker attack. In order to avoid this, it may be neces-sary to increase the variance of the noise added as a function of the number of queries issued. This implies that the utility of the responses would be further reduced. These results raise serious questions regarding the viability of Laplace based noise addition for masking numeric data.},

The logics are studied within the abstract framework of coalgebraic modal logic, which can be instantiated with arbitrary endofunctors on the category of sets. This is achieved through the use of predicate liftings, which generalise atomic propositions and modal operators from Kripke models to arbitrary coalgebras. Predicate liftings also allow us to use induction along the terminal sequence of the underlying endofunctor as a proof principle. This induction principle is systematically exploited to establish soundness, completeness and decidability of the logics. We believe that this induction principle also opens new ways for reasoning about modal logics: Our proof of completeness does not rely on a canonical model construction, and the proof of the finite model property does not use filtrations.},

Gudder and S. Bugajski are special cases of a more general model; 4. a good model allows natural modifications. Second, we show that the category ID of D-posets of fuzzy sets and sequentially continuous D-homomorphisms allows to characterize the passage from classical to fuzzy events as the minimal generalization having nontrivial quantum character: a degenerated state can be transported to a nondegenerated one. Third, we describe a general model of probability theory based on the category ID so that the classical and fuzzy probability theories become special cases and the model allows natural modifications. Finally, we present a modification in which the closed unit interval [0,1] as the domain of traditional states is replaced by a suitable simplex.},

The proposed functional decomposes into conversant uncertainty measures and therefore discloses a new interpretation of the latters as well. By abstracting to equivalence classes of hints we transport the new measure to mass functions in Dempster-Shafer theory and analyse its relationship with the aggregate uncertainty, which currently is the only known functional for the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence that satisfies the same set of properties. Moreover, the perspective of hints reveals that the standard independence notion in Dempster-Shafer theory called non-interactivity corresponds to an amalgamation of probabilistic independence and qualitative independence between frames of discernment. All results in this paper are developed for arbitrary families of compatible frames generalizing the very specialized multi-variate systems that are usually studied in information theory. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Monads are extensively used nowadays to abstractly model a wide range of computational effects such as nondeterminism, statefulness, and exceptions. It turns out that equipping a monad with a (uniform) iteration operator satisfying a set of natural axioms allows for modelling iterative computations just as abstractly. The emerging monads are called complete Elgot monads. It has been shown recently that extending complete Elgot monads with free effects (e.g. operations of sending/receiving messages over channels) canonically leads to generalized coalgebraic resumption monads, previously used as semantic domains for non-wellfounded guarded processes. In this paper, we continue the study of the relationship between abstract complete Elgot monads and those that capture coalgebraic resumptions, by comparing the corresponding categories of (Eilenberg-Moore) algebras. To this end we first provide a characterization of the latter category; even more generally, we formulate this characterization in terms of Uustalu's parametrized monads. This is further used for establishing a characterization of complete Elgot monads as precisely those monads whose algebras are coherently equipped with the structure of algebras of coalgebraic resumption monads.},

We do this in the case of algebraic effects where the operations are given by a single-sorted algebraic signature, and their semantics is supported by the monad, in a certain sense. We consider call-by-value PCF with— and without—recursion, an extension of $\lambda$ c with arithmetic.

abstract = {We revisit our earlier work on the representation of quantum systems as Chu spaces, and investigate the use of coalgebra as an alternative framework. On the one hand, coalgebras allow the dynamics of repeated measurement to be captured, and provide mathematical tools such as final coalgebras, bisimulation and coalgebraic logic. However, the standard coalgebraic framework does not accommodate contravariance, and is too rigid to allow physical symmetries to be represented. We introduce a fibrational structure on coalgebras in which contravariance is represented by indexing. We use this structure to give a universal semantics for quantum systems based on a final coalgebra construction. We characterize equality in this semantics as projective equivalence. We also define an analogous indexed structure for Chu spaces, and use this to obtain a novel categorical description of the category of Chu spaces. We use the indexed structures of Chu spaces and coalgebras over a common base to define a truncation functor from coalgebras to Chu spaces. This truncation functor is used to lift the full and faithful representation of the groupoid of physical symmetries on Hilbert spaces into Chu spaces, obtained in our previous work, to the coalgebraic semantics.},

Innovative categorical concepts in category theory include homological algebra, universal algebra, set theory, and enumerative combinatorics. The chapter emphasizes categories as vital mathematical structures. It also explores some fundamental interconnections involving rewrite systems, free higher-order categories, cubes and simplexes, and homotopy theory. A (directed) graph G consists of two sets G0, G1 and an ordered pair of functions. The elements of G0 are called “objects,” “vertices,” or “0-cells.” The elements of G1 are called “arrows,” “edges,” or “1-cells.” Repeated horizontal and vertical composition in a 2-category K determines a more general operation called “pasting.” Each free 2-category A has a length 2-functor ℓ: A →M induced by the unique computed morphism between the generating computads. The connection between categories and the Bazhanov–Stroganov d-simplex equations arisen in statistical and quantum mechanics are also presented.},

@article{Makkai1996,
abstract = {The notion of anafunctor is introduced. An anafunctor is, roughly, a "functor defined up to isomorphism". Anafunctors have a general theory paralleling that of ordinary functors; they have natural transformations, they form categories, they can be composed, etc. Anafunctors can be saturated, to ensure that any object isomorphic to a possible value of the anafunctor is also a possible value at the same argument object. The existence of anafunctors in situations when ordinarily one would use choice is ensured without choice; e.g., for a category which has binary products, but not specified binary products, the anaversion of the product functor is canonically definable, unlike the ordinary product functor that needs the axiom of choice. When the composition functors in a bicategory are changed into anafunctors, one obtains anabicategories. In the standard definitions of bicategories such as the monoidal category of modules over a ring, or the bicategory of spans in a category with pullbacks, and many others, one uses choice; the anaversions of these bicategories have canonical definitions. The overall effect is an elimination of the axiom of choice, and of non-canonical choices, in large parts of general category theory. To ensure the Cartesian closed character of the bicategory of small categories, with anafunctors as 1-cells, one uses a weak version of the axiom of choice, which is related to A. Blass' axiom of Small Violations of Choice (1979).},

abstract = {Inspired by a number of different applications of rewriting logic, equational logic, and type theory that we present and further advance in this thesis, we study a unified formalism based on the key aspects of these quite different lines of research. The resulting formalism, that we call the open calculus of constructions, is intended as a step towards our long-term goal of developing a unified language for programming, specification and interactive theorem proving. \nWe begin our work by exploring the application of rewriting logic as a semantic framework for concurrency. To this end, we give a unified treatment of different classes of Petri nets, a typical and important representative of a class of formalisms that are used for the modeling and specification of concurrent and distributed systems based on a multiset representation of a distributed state space. Specifically, we continue the line of research initiated by Meseguer and Montanari under the motto "Petri nets are monoids" by giving a rewriting semantics for different Petri nets classes. In particular, we have covered important high-level Petri net models, namely algebraic net specifications and colored Petri nets, and we have proved that the models of our representations are naturally isomorphic to the well-known Best-Devillers process semantics. Apart from their contribution to a conceptual unification in this field, the main practical advantage of our representations in rewriting logic is their executability, which allows us to use a rewriting engine such as Maude for the efficient symbolic execution of system models and for their analysis. \nThe next application addressed in this thesis is the use of type theory, more precisely the calculus of inductive constructions, as a logical framework and for metalogical reasoning. Specifically, we have used the COQ proof assistant in a formally rigorous development of a UNITY-style temporal logic, which generalizes the original UNITY approach in important aspects. Since all inference rules of the temporal logic are proved as theorems in the metalogic, the result of the development is a verified temporal logic library, which due to the use of labeled transition systems as a semantic basis, can be employed for a wide range of system models, Petri nets and rewriting logic specifications being particular examples. The development also includes a new application of the proposition-as-types interpretation in the context of compositional reasoning. \nThe use of membership equational logic or rewriting logic as a semantic and logical framework for higher-order languages, or more generally languages with binding constructs, obviously requires a first-order treatment of names and relevant operations such as substitutions. To systematically address such applications, we develop CINNI, a new calculus of names and substitutions, that takes names seriously in the sense that it does not abstract from names, and is generic in the sense that it can be instantiated to arbitrary object languages. Our calculus unifies the standard named notation and a notation based on de Bruijn indices by employing a representation that was originally developed by Berkling for the lambda-calculus. It furthermore nicely generalizes the calculus lambda upsilon of explicit substitutions developed by Lescanne, and, as we show, most metatheoretic results can be generalized to the new calculus. We furthermore give a very general confluence result for the composition of CINNI with the equations or rules capturing the dynamics of the object language, and we in particular discuss how our approach can be applied to the representation of the untyped lambda-calculus, Abadi and Cardelli's object calculus, also called the sigma-calculus, and Milner's pi-calculus for communicating and mobile systems. As a real-world application of CINNI we briefly discuss a specification of an active network programming language in the rewriting-logic-based language Maude. \nWe more specifically address the use of membership equational logic and rewriting logic as a first-order logical framework by representing an important class of pure type systems. Pure type systems generalize a variety of different type theories, including the calculus of constructions and its well-known subsystems, and can be seen as higher-order logics via the propositions-as-types interpretation. Following a methodology based on Meseguer's general logics in combination with rewriting logic as a concrete logical framework, we have studied representations of pure type systems at different levels of abstractions, ranging from an abstract textbook representation to a more concrete executable representation of an important subclass, which can directly serve as a type inference and type checking algorithm. The latter representation is based on a new notion of uniform pure type systems, which take names seriously thanks to the CINNI calculus and simultaneously offer a possible solution to the known problem with alpha-closure pointed out by Pollack. Using an example, in which we validate proofs developed with the LEGO proof assistant in an extension of the calculus of constructions with universes, we have demonstrated how our approach directly leads to an executable prototype in a rewriting logic language such as Maude. \nAs an application of type theory in the context of classical reasoning we study Howe's HOL/Nuprl connection, which addresses the problem of formal interoperability between proof assistents, from the viewpoint of Meseguer's general logics. We supplement Howe's semantic justification by a proof-theoretic correctness argument, a piece of work which has lead to proof-translation as new interesting application (explored in joint work with Naumov) that goes beyond Howe's original HOL/Nuprl connection. From a theoretical perspective we found that the core idea of the HOL/Nuprl connection, namely the beneficial coexistence of an intensional and an extensional logic in the same formal system, does not rely on any of the advanced concepts of Nuprl, but can equally well be used in Martin-L{\"{o}}f's type theory and can further be easily adopted to type theories in the line of calculus of constructions. \nThe final and main contribution of this thesis is the development of a formalism that we call the open calculus of constructions (OCC). It is based on the surprisingly powerful interaction between its two key features, namely dependent types, in the spirit of Martin-L{\"{o}}f's type theory and the calculus of constructions, and the computational system of rewriting logic and its underlying membership equational logic, which is based on conditional rewriting modulo equations. The applications of membership equational logic, rewriting logic, and type theory, studied in this thesis have not only inspired the development of this unifying formalism, but they become applications of OCC itself and benefit from its use in an essential way. On the theoretical side, we introduce OCC by presenting a classical set-theoretic semantics and a formal system for which we prove soundness and consistency as a logic. The formal system is used to define derivable judgements together with their operational semantics, and is based on the ideas that we developed earlier in the context of uniform pure type systems. The model-theoretic semantics that we develop in this thesis is a very intuitive semantics with proof-irrelevance for impredicative universes, but unlike existing approaches it is more direct and can be given independently of the formal system. Using an experimental prototype of OCC, that we implemented in Maude following the approach to the specification of type theories mentioned before in combination with reflective techniques, we have developed a large collection of examples, many of which are closely related to the applications discussed earlier in this thesis. These examples do not only convey the pragmatics of OCC, but they simultaneously provide a proof-of-concept for our approach. Among the topics covered by our examples we find executable equational/behavioral specifications, programming with dependent types, symbolic execution of system models, formalization of algebraic and categorical concepts, inductive/coinductive theorem proving, and theorem proving modulo equational theories.},

abstract = {We explore some novel connections between the main privacy models in use and we recall a few known ones. We show these models to be more related than commonly understood, around two main principles: deniability and permutation. In particular, randomized response turns out to be very modern in spite of it having been introduced over 50 years ago: it is a local anonymization method and it allows understanding the protection offered by $\epsilon$-differential privacy when $\epsilon$ is increased to improve utility. A similar understanding on the effect of large $\epsilon$ in terms of deniability is obtained from the connection between $\epsilon$-differential privacy and t-closeness. Finally, the post-randomization method (PRAM) is shown to be viewable as permutation and to be connected with randomized response and differential privacy. Since the latter is also connected with t-closeness, it follows that the permutation principle can explain the guarantees offered by all those models. Thus, calibrating permutation is very relevant in anonymization, and we conclude by sketching two ways of doing it.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data analysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been adequately addressed. We develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. We present the first sound verification technique for proving differential privacy of interactive systems. The technique is based on a form of probabilistic bisimulation relation. The novelty lies in the way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is intended to provide differential privacy. Surprisingly, our analysis yields a privacy leakage bound of (2t* ??) rather than (t* ??) when ??differentially private functions are called t times. The extra leakage arises from accounting for bounded memory constraints of real computers. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary – ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function – is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {" Privacy " and " utility " are words that frequently appear in the lit-erature on statistical privacy. But what do these words really mean? In recent years, many problems with intuitive notions of privacy and utility have been un-covered. Thus more formal notions of privacy and utility, which are amenable to mathematical analysis, are needed. In this paper we present our initial work on an axiomatization of privacy and utility. We present two privacy axioms which describe how privacy is affected by both post-processing data and by randomly se-lecting a privacy mechanism. We present three axioms for utility measures which also describe how measured utility is affected by post-processing. Our analysis of these axioms yields new insights into the construction of privacy definitions and utility measures. In particular, we characterize the class of relaxations of differ-ential privacy that can be obtained by changing constraints on probabilities; we show that the resulting constraints must be formed from concave functions. We also present several classes of utility metrics satisfying our axioms and explicitly show that measures of utility borrowed from statistics can lead to utility paradoxes when applied to statistical privacy. Finally, we show that the outputs of differ-entially private algorithms are best interpreted in terms of graphs or likelihood functions rather than query answers or synthetic data.},

As a corollary, we obtain that the Vietoris functor does not preserve weak pullbacks. Comparing Vietoris bisimulations between descriptive models to Kripke bisimulations on the underlying Kripke models, we prove that the closure of such a Kripke bisimulation is a Vietoris bisimulation.

Proofs of all results have been formally verified by the Coq proof assistant, and the proof scripts for this verification form an essential component of this research.},

abstract = {There are relatively few proposals for inconsistency measures for propositional belief bases. However inconsistency measures are potentially as important as information measures for artificial intelligence, and more generally for computer science. In particular, they can be useful to define various operators for belief revision, belief merging, and negotiation. The measures that have been proposed so far can be split into two classes. The first class of measures takes into account the number of formulae required to produce an inconsistency: the more formulae required to produce an inconsistency, the less inconsistent the base. The second class takes into account the proportion of the language that is affected by the inconsistency: the more propositional variables affected, the more inconsistent the base. Both approaches are sensible, but there is no proposal for combining them. We address this need in this paper: our proposal takes into account both the number of variables affected by the inconsistency and the distribution of the inconsistency among the formulae of the base. Our idea is to use existing inconsistency measures in order to define a game in coalitional form, and then to use the Shapley value to obtain an inconsistency measure that indicates the responsibility/contribution of each formula to the overall inconsistency in the base. This allows us to provide a more reliable image of the belief base and of the inconsistency in it.},

abstract = {The distributed temporal logic DTL is an expressive logic, well suited for formalizing properties of concurrent, communicating agents. We show how DTL can be used as a metalogic to reason about and relate different security protocol models. This includes reasoning about model simplifications, where models are transformed to have fewer agents or behaviors, and verifying model reductions, where to establish the validity of a property it suffices to consider its satisfaction on only a subset of models. We illustrate how DTL can be used to formalize security models, protocols, and properties, and then present three concrete examples of metareasoning. First, we prove a general theorem about sufficient conditions for data to remain secret during communication. Second, we prove the equivalence of two models for guaranteeing message-origin authentication. Finally, we relate channel-based and intruder-centric models, showing that it is sufficient to consider models in which the intruder completely controls the network. While some of these results belong to the folklore or have been shown, mutatis mutandis, using other formalisms, DTL provides a uniform means to prove them within the same formalism. It also allows us to clarify subtle aspects of these model transformations that are often neglected or cannot be specified in the first place. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recognizing ongoing MM-attacks is an important security task; modeling MM-interactions is an interesting task for semantics of computation. Traced monoidal categories are a natural framework for MM-modelling, as the trace structure provides a tool to hide what happens *in the middle*. An effective analysis of what has been traced out seems to require an additional property of traces, called *normality*. We describe a modest model of network computation, based on partially ordered multisets (pomsets), where basic network interactions arise from the monoidal trace structure, and a normal trace structure arises from an iterative, i.e. coalgebraic structure over terms and messages used in computation and communication. The correspondence is established using a convenient monadic description of normally traced monoidal categories.},

We prove that whenever an endofunctor H of a category has final coalgebras for all functors H(_)+X, then those coalgebras, TX, form a monad. This monad is completely iterative, i.e., every guarded system of recursive equations has a unique solution. And it is a free completely iterative monad on H. The special case of polynomial endofunctors of the category Set is the above mentioned theory, or monad, of infinite trees. This procedure can be generalized to monoidal categories satisfying a mild side condition: if, for an object H, the endofunctor H ⊗_+I has a final coalgebra, T, then T is a monoid. This specializes to the above case for the monoidal category of all endofunctors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The mu-calculus and its relatives are among the most expressive logics of this type. However, popular fixpoint logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and readability, and in fact often live within the single variable fragment of the mu-calculus. The family of such flat fixpoint logics includes, e.g., LTL, CTL, and the logic of common knowledge. Extending this notion to the generic semantic framework of coalgebraic logic enables covering a wide range of logics beyond the standard mu-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the graded mu-calculus and the alternating-time mu-calculus (such as alternating-time temporal logic ATL), as well as probabilistic and monotone fixpoint logics. We give a generic proof of completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization for such flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics.},

[Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, 2000, p. 358] analyzed a new way of model-checking formulas of a logic for continuous-time processes - called continuous stochastic logic (henceforth CSL) - against continuous-time Markov chains - henceforth CTMCs. One of the important results of that paper was the proof that if two CTMCs were bisimilar then they would satisfy exactly the same formulas of CSL. This raises the converse question - does satisfaction of the same collection of CSL formulas imply bisimilarity? In other words, given two CTMCs which are known to satisfy exactly the same formulas of CSL does it have to be the case that they are bisimilar? We prove that the answer to the question just raised is "yes". In fact we prove a significant extension, namely that a subset of CSL suffices even for systems where the state space may be a continuum. Along the way we prove a result to the effect that the set of Zeno paths has measure zero provided that the transition rates are bounded. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {We establish completeness for intuitionistic first-order logic, iFOL, showing that a formula is provable if and only if its embedding into minimal logic, mFOL, is uniformly valid under the Brouwer Heyting Kolmogorov (BHK) semantics, the intended semantics of iFOL and mFOL. Our proof is intuitionistic and provides an effective procedure Prf that converts uniform minimal evidence into a formal first-order proof. We have implemented Prf. Uniform validity is defined using the intersection operator as a universal quantifier over the domain of discourse and atomic predicates. Formulas of iFOL that are uniformly valid are also intuitionistically valid, but not conversely. Our strongest result requires the Fan Theorem; it can also be proved classically by showing that Prf terminates using Konig's Theorem. The fundamental idea behind our completeness theorem is that a single evidence term evd witnesses the uniform validity of a minimal logic formula F. Finding even one uniform realizer guarantees intuitionistic validity because Prf(F, evd) builds a first-order proof of F, establishing its intuitionistic validity and providing a purely logical normalized realizer. We establish completeness for iFOL as follows. Friedman showed that iFOL can be embedded in minimal logic (mFOL) by his A-transformation, mapping formula F to FA. If F is uniformly valid, then so is FA, and by our completeness theorem, we can find a proof of FA in minimal logic. Then we intuitionistically prove F from FFalse, i.e. by taking False for A and for \bot of mFOL. Our result resolves an open question posed by Beth in 1947.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. A mathematical model is developed to provide a theoretical frame-work for a computer-oriented solution to the problem of recognizing those records in two files which represent identical persons, objects or events (said to be matched). A comparison is to be made between the recorded characteristics and values in two records (one from each file) and a decision made as to whether or not the members of the comparison-pair represent the same person or event, or whether there is insufficient evidence to justify either of these decisions at stipulated levels of error. These three decisions are referred to as link (A1), a non-link (A3), and a possible link (A2). The first two decisions are called positive dispositions. The two types of error are defined as the error of the decision A, when the members of the comparison pair are in fact unmatched, and the error of the decision A, when the members of the comparison pair are, in fact matched. The probabilities of these errors are defined as = E u(y)P(A,I y) rer and X m(r)P(AaIr) yTr respectively where u(y), m(y) are the probabilities of realizing y (a comparison vector whose components are the coded agreements and disagreements on each characteristic) for unmatched and matched record pairs respectively. The summation is over the whole comparison space r of possible realizations. A linkage rule assigns probabilities P(A, Iy), and P(A2 1y), and P(A3 'y) to each possible realization of y e P. An optimal linkage rule L (u, X, r) is defined for each value of (,u, X) as the rule that minimizes P(A2) at those error levels. In other words, for fixed levels of error, the rule minimizes the probability of failing to make positive dispositions. A theorem describing the construction and properties of the optimal linkage rule and two corollaries to the theorem which make it a practical working tool are given.},

The main complication stems from the fact that the actions of intermediate nodes and their connectivity can no longer be abstracted into a single unstructured adversarial environment as they form an inherent part of the system's security. In order to model this scenario faithfully, we present a broadcast calculus which makes a clear distinction between the protocol processes and the network's connectivity graph, which may change independently from protocol actions. We identify a property characterising an important aspect of security in this setting and express it using behavioural equivalences of the calculus. We complement this approach with a control flow analysis which enables us to automatically check this property on a given network and attacker specification. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There are a number of variants and special cases of these models and we present them in Section 1. In Section 2 we summarize those mathematical theories which can be used to prove the convexity of large classes of our problems and we also show how they can be applied in this context. In Section 3 we present solution algorithms of our stochastic programming problems. Since we are handling probabilities of sets in higher dimensional spaces, it is necessary to use bounding and other approximation algorithms to find these probabilities with satisfactory precision. This is the subject of Section 5. In Section 4 we present two-stage and multi-stage problems which are combined with probabilistic constraints. Some duality and stability theorems are presented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we present applications of our model constructions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We model such systems as coalgebras whose type arises as the composition of a branching monad with one or more polynomial endofunctors on the category of sets. The domain of truth values for our logics is determined by the choice of branching monad, as is the special modality used to abstract away branching in the semantics of the logics. To justify our choice of syntax and semantics for the logics, we prove the equivalence between their step-wise semantics and an alternative path-based semantics for the fixpoint-free fragments of the logics. Instances of these logics support reasoning about the possibility, probability or minimal cost of exhibiting a given linear time property. We conclude with two examples of logics that have a linear time flavour but do not admit a path-based semantics, namely a logic for reasoning about resource usage in infinitely-running computations, and a quantitative logic for reasoning about component interaction.},

Under certain conditions it can be shown to uniquely characterise functions into the carrier of a final F-coalgebra, generalising the basic coiteration schema as given by finality. The duals of primitive recursion and course-of-value iteration, which are known extensions of coiteration, arise as instances of our framework. One can furthermore obtain schemata justifying recursive specifications that involve operators such as addition of power series, regular operators on languages, or parallel and sequential composition of processes. Next, the same type of distributive law $\lambda$ is used to generalise coinductive proof techniques. To this end, we introduce the notion of a $\lambda$-bisimulation relation. It specialises to what could be called bisimulation up-to-equality or bisimulation up-to-context for contexts built from operators of the type mentioned above. We state that every such relation is contained in some larger conventional bisimulation and demonstrate that this principle leads to simpler bisimilarity proofs using less complex relations. {\textcopyright}2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The rule of combination was studied extensively, but only in the case of finite sets of possibilities, in the author's monograph A Mathematical Theory of Evidence.

Our main theorem here states that a functor preserves sifted colimits if and only if it has a finitary presentation by operations and equations. Moreover, the presentation of the category of algebras for the functor is obtained compositionally from the presentations of the underlying category and of the functor. Part II investigates algebras for a functor over ind-completions and extends the theorem of J{\'o}nsson and Tarski on canonical extensions of Boolean algebras with operators to this setting. Part III shows, based on Part I, how to associate a finitary logic to any finite-sets preserving functor T. Based on Part II we prove the logic to be strongly complete under a reasonable condition on T.},

The most established one relies on the notion of a type-category (or category with attributes) with $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ types. We extend such a semantics by introducing coinductive types both on the syntactic level and in a type-category. Soundness of the semantics is preserved. As an example of such a category, we prove that the type-category built over a locally cartesian closed category C admits coinductive types whenever C has final coalgebras for all polynomial functors.},

History and prophecy relations are abstract versions of the history and prophecy variables of Abadi and Lamport, as well as the auxiliary variables of Owicki and Gries, Relationships between the different types of simulations, as well as soundness and completeness results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is shown how invariants can be incorporated into all the simulations. Even though many results are presented here for the first time, this paper can also be read as a survey (in a simple setting) of the research literature on simulation techniques. The development for untimed automata is designed to support a similar development for timed automata, Part II of this paper will show how the results of this paper can be carried over to the setting of timed automata.},

abstract = {So-called effect algebras and modules are basic mathematical structures that were first identified in mathematical physics, for the study of quantum logic and quantum probability. They incorporate a double negation law $p^{\perp\perp} = p. Since then it has been realised that these effect structures form a useful abstraction that covers not only quantum logic, but also Boolean logic and probabilistic logic. Moreover, the duality between effect and convex structures lies at the heart of the duality between predicates and states. These insights are leading to a uniform framework for the semantics of computation and logic. This framework has been elaborated elsewhere for set-theoretic, discrete probabilistic, and quantum computation. Here the missing case of continuous probability is shown to fit in the same uniform framework. On a technical level, this involves an investigation of the logical aspects of the Giry monad on measurable spaces and of Lebesgue integration.},

abstract = {One of the most studied extensions of testing theory to nondeterministic and probabilistic processes yields unrealistic probabilities estimations that give rise to two anomalies. First, probabilistic testing equivalence does not imply probabilistic trace equivalence. Second, probabilistic testing equivalence differentiates processes that perform the same sequence of actions with the same probability but make internal choices in different moments and thus, when applied to processes without probabilities, does not coincide with classical testing equivalence. In this paper, new versions of probabilistic trace and testing equivalences are presented for nondeterministic and probabilistic processes that resolve the two anomalies. Instead of focussing only on suprema and infima of the set of success probabilities of resolutions of interaction systems, our testing equivalence matches all the resolutions on the basis of the success probabilities of their identically labeled computations. A simple spectrum is provided to relate the new relations with existing ones. It is also shown that, with our approach, the standard probabilistic testing equivalences for generative and reactive probabilistic processes can be retrieved.},

abstract = {This paper aims at answering the following two questions in privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing: What formal privacy guarantee (if any) does $k$-anonymization provide? How to benefit from the adversary's uncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a connection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create uncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done "safely", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This result illustrates that "hiding in a crowd of $k$" indeed offers some privacy guarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output perturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random sampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to change of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a random-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can greatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset resulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the negative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's uncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in practice.},

Our results are semantic in nature and build upon Hermida and Jacobs' fibrational formulation of induction for polynomial data types and its extension to all inductive data types by Ghani, Johann, and Fumex. An effectful data type $\mu$ ( TF ) is built from a functor F that describes data, and a monad T that computes effects. Our main contribution is to derive induction rules that are generic over all functors F and monads T such that $\mu$ ( TF ) exists. Along the way, we also derive a principle of definition by structural recursion for effectful data types that is similarly generic. Our induction rule is also generic over the kinds of properties to be proved: like the work on which we build, we work in a general fibrational setting and so can accommodate very general notions of properties, rather than just those of particular syntactic forms. We give examples exploiting the generality of our results, and show how our results specialize to those in the literature, particularly those of Filinski and St{\o}vring.},

abstract = {In some bicategories, the 1-cells are 'morphisms' between the 0-cells, such as functors between categories, but in others they are 'objects' over the 0-cells, such as bimodules, spans, distributors, or parametrized spectra. Many bicategorical notions do not work well in these cases, because the 'morphisms between 0-cells', such as ring homomorphisms, are missing. We can include them by using a pseudo double category, but usually these morphisms also induce base change functors acting on the 1-cells. We avoid complicated coherence problems by describing base change 'nonalgebraically', us-ing categorical fibrations. The resulting 'framed bicategories' assemble into 2-categories, with attendant notions of equivalence, adjunction, and so on which are more appropriate for our examples than are the usual bicategorical ones. We then describe two ways to construct framed bicategories. One is an analogue of rings and bimodules which starts from one framed bicategory and builds another. The other starts from a 'monoidal fibration', meaning a parametrized family of monoidal categories, and produces an analogue of the framed bicategory of spans. Combining the two, we obtain a construction which includes both enriched and internal categories as special cases.},

The Pufferfish framework can be used to create new privacy definitions that are customized to the needs of a given application. The goal of Pufferfish is to allow experts in an application domain, who frequently do not have expertise in privacy, to develop rigorous privacy definitions for their data sharing needs. In addition to this, the Pufferfish framework can also be used to study existing privacy definitions. We illustrate the benefits with several applications of this privacy framework: we use it to analyze differ- ential privacy and formalize a connection to attackers who believe that the data records are independent; we use it to create a privacy definition called hedging privacy, which can be used to rule out attackers whose prior beliefs are inconsistent with the data; we use the framework to define and study the notion of composi- tion in a broader context than before; we show how to apply the framework to protect unbounded continuous attributes and aggregate information; and we show how to use the framework to rigorously account for prior data releases.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the relation between three different notions of privacy: identifiability, differential privacy and mutual-information privacy. Under a unified privacy-distortion framework, where the distortion is defined to be the Hamming distance of the input and output databases, we establish some fundamental connections between these three privacy notions. Given a distortion level $D$, define $\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest (best) identifiability level, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest differential privacy level. We characterize $\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$, and prove that $\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)-\epsilon_X\le\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)\le\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ for $D$ in some range, where $\epsilon_X$ is a constant depending on the distribution of the original database $X$, and diminishes to zero when the distribution of $X$ is uniform. Furthermore, we show that identifiability and mutual-information privacy are consistent in the sense that given distortion level $D$, the mechanism that optimizes the mutual-information privacy also minimizes the identifiability level.},

As the application grows, reliable operation, portability, and maintainability gets to be a real concern. However, this can be tamed by abstracting away from the platform-dependent details by modelling the components and their relation on a higher level. Using a functional programming language combined with the technique of language embedding may be an answer when implementation of such solution comes in question [1][2]. In this design, the component descriptions may be captured by an adequate embedded domain-specific language that compiles to a lower-level language but there also has to be a way for composition and therefore getting a complete working application out of them. In this paper, we propose a method for extending compiled embedded domain-specific languages into a stand-alone system with minimal effort. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Awodey2013,
abstract = {From a logical point of view, Stone duality for Boolean algebras relates theories in classical propositional logic and their collections of models. The theories can be seen as presentations of Boolean algebras, and the collections of models can be topologized in such a way that the theory can be recovered from its space of models. The situation can be cast as a formal duality relating two categories of syntax and semantics, mediated by homming into a common dualizing object, in this case 2.In the present work, we generalize the entire arrangement from propositional to first-order logic, using a representation result of Butz and Moerdijk. Boolean algebras are replaced by Boolean categories presented by theories in first-order logic, and spaces of models are replaced by topological groupoids of models and their isomorphisms. A duality between the resulting categories of syntax and semantics, expressed primarily in the form of a contravariant adjunction, is established by homming into a common dualizing object, now Sets, regarded once as a boolean category, and once as a groupoid equipped with an intrinsic topology.The overall framework of our investigation is provided by topos theory. Direct proofs of the main results are given, but the specialist will recognize toposophical ideas in the background. Indeed, the duality between syntax and semantics is really a manifestation of that between algebra and geometry in the two directions of the geometric morphisms that lurk behind our formal theory. Along the way, we give an elementary proof of Butz and Moerdijk's result in logical terms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The contingency table is a work horse of official statistics, the format of reported data for the US Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Internal Revenue Service. In many settings such as these privacy is not only ethically mandated, but frequently legally as well. Consequently there is an extensive and diverse literature dedicated to the problems of statistical disclosure control in contingency table release. However, all current techniques for reporting contingency tables fall short on at leas one of privacy, accuracy, and consistency (among multiple released tables). We propose a solution that provides strong guarantees for all three desiderata simultaneously. Our approach can be viewed as a special case of a more general approach for producing synthetic data: Any privacy-preserving mechanism for contingency table release begins with raw data and produces a (possibly inconsistent) privacy-preserving set of marginals. From these tables alone-and hence without weakening privacy--we will find and output the "nearest" consistent set of marginals. Interestingly, this set is no farther than the tables of the raw data, and consequently the additional error introduced by the imposition of consistency is no more than the error introduced by the privacy mechanism itself. The privacy mechanism of [20] gives the strongest known privacy guarantees, with very little error. Combined with the techniques of the current paper, we therefore obtain excellent privacy, accuracy, and consistency among the tables. Moreover, our techniques are surprisingly efficient. Our techniques apply equally well to the logical cousin of the contingency table, the OLAP cube.},

Indeed, it is the ubiquity of this programming pattern that drew us to the abstraction. We retrace our steps in this paper, introducing the applicative pattern by diverse exam- ples, then abstracting it to define the Applicative type class and introducing a bracket notation which interprets the normal application syntax in the idiom of an Applicative functor. Further, we develop the properties of applicative functors and the generic opera- tions they support.We close by identifying the categorical structure of applicative functors and examining their relationship both with Monads and with Arrows.},

However, sometimes we are also interested in the 'journey' - the intermediate course of a computation - especially when reasoning about non-terminating interactive systems. In this article we claim that a necessary property of a monad for it to be able to describe the behaviour of a program is complete iterativity. We show how an ordinary monad can be modified to disclose more about its internal computational behaviour, by applying an associated transformer to a completely iterative monad. To illustrate this, we introduce two new constructions: a coinductive cousin of Cenciarelli and Moggi's generalised resumption transformer, and States - a State-like monad that accumulates the intermediate states. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Much of relational algebra and the underlying principles of relational database design have a simple representation in the theory of domains that is traditionally used in the denotational semantics of programming languages. By investigating the possible orderings on powerdomains that are well known in the study of nondeterminism and concurrency it is possible to show that many of the ideas in relational databases apply to structures that are much more general than relations. This also suggests a method of representing database objects as typed objects in programming languages. In this paper we show how operations such as natural join and projection-which are fundamental to relational database design-can be generalized, and we use this generalized framework to give characterizations of several relational database concepts including functional dependencies and universal relations. All of these have a simple-minded semantics in terms of the underlying domains, which can be thought of as domains of partial descriptions of "real-world" objects. We also discuss the applicability of relational database theory to nonrelational structures such as records with variants, higher-order relations, recursive structures and other ordered spaces. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The most common techniques are based on the introduction of probabilistic noise, often defined as a Laplacian parametric on the sensitivity of the query. In order to maximize the utility of the query, it is crucial to estimate the sensitivity as precisely as possible. In this paper we consider relational algebra, the classical language for queries in relational databases, and we propose a method for computing a bound on the sensitivity of queries in an intuitive and compositional way. We use constraint-based techniques to accumulate the information on the possible values for attributes provided by the various components of the query, thus making it possible to compute tight bounds on the sensitivity.},

Inductively defined FM-sets involving the name-abstraction set former (together with Cartesian product and disjoint union) can correctly encode syntax modulo renaming of bound variables. In this way, the standard theory of algebraic data types can be extended to encompass signatures involving binding operators. In particular, there is an associated notion of structural recursion for defining syntax-manipulating functions (such as capture avoiding substitution, set of free variables, etc.) and a notion of proof by structural induction, both of which remain pleasingly close to informal practice in computer science.},

abstract = {We continue a line of research initiated in [10,11]on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = ?i g(xi), where xi denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0, 1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard devi- ation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation re- sults showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.},

Here we attempt to close this gap by giving a coalgebraic treatment of (parametrized) weak equivalences, including weak bisimulation. Our analysis requires that the functor defining the transition type of the system is based on a suitable order-enriched monad, which allows us to capture weak equivalences by least fixpoints of recursive equations.

In this paper we consider the problems of finding and masking quasi-identifiers. Both problems are provably hard with se-vere time and space requirements. We focus on designing efficient approximation algorithms for large data sets. We first propose two natural measures for quantifying quasi-identifiers: distinct ratio and separation ratio. We develop efficient algorithms that find small quasi-identifiers with provable size and separation/distinct ratio guarantees, with space and time requirements sublinear in the number of tuples. We also design practical algorithms for finding all minimal quasi-identifiers. Finally we propose efficient algo-rithms for masking quasi-identifiers, where we use a random sampling technique to greatly reduce the space and time requirements, without much sacrifice in the quality of the results. Our algorithms for masking and finding minimum quasi-identifiers naturally apply to stream databases. Ex-tensive experimental results on real world data sets confirm efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms.},

We investigate semisimple, locally finite, finitely approximated and splitting varieties of monadic Heyting algebras as well as varieties with the disjunction and the existence properties. The investigation of monadic Heyting algebras clarifies the correspondence between intuitionistic modal logics over MIPC and superintuitionistic predicate logics and provides us with the solutions of several problems raised by Ono [35].},

abstract = {Whilst the relationship between initial algebras and monads is well-understood, the relationship between final coalgebras and comonads is less well explored. This paper shows that the problem is more subtle and that final coalgebras can just as easily form monads as comonads and dually, that initial algebras form both monads and comonads. In developing these theories we strive to provide them with an associated notion of syntax. In the case of initial algebras and monads this corresponds to the standard notion of algebraic theories consisting of signatures and equations: models of such algebraic theories are precisely the algebras of the representing monad. We attempt to emulate this result for the coalgebraic case by defining a notion cosignature and coequation and then proving the models of this syntax are precisely the coalgebras of the representing comonad. {\textcopyright}2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.

We state a list of six desired properties of entropy for DS belief functions theory, four of which are motivated by Shannon's definition of entropy of probability functions, and the remaining two are requirements that adapt this measure to the philosophy of the DS theory. Three of our six desired properties are different from the five properties proposed by Klir and Wierman. We demonstrate that our definition satisfies all six properties in our list, whereas none of the existing definitions do. Our new definition has two components. The first component is Shannon's entropy of an equivalent probability mass function obtained using the plausibility transform, which constitutes the conflict measure of entropy. The second component is Dubois–Prade's definition of entropy of basic probability assignments in the DS theory, which constitutes the non-specificity measure of entropy. Our new definition is the sum of these two components. Our definition does not satisfy the subadditivity property. Whether there exists a definition that satisfies our six properties plus subadditivity remains an open question.},

The preservation of monics by T is sufficient to imply convergence, necessarily to a terminal coalgebra. We can say much more if K is Set, and $\kappa$ is $\omega$. In that case it is well known that we do not necessarily get convergence at $\omega$, however we show that to ensure convergence we don't need to go to a higher cardinal, just to the next limit ordinal, $\omega$ + $\omega$. For an $\omega$-accessible endofunctor T on Set the construction of the terminal coalgebra can thus be seen as a two stage construction, with each stage being finitary. The first stage obtains the Cauchy completion of the initial T-algebra as the $\omega$-th object in the terminalsequenceA$\omega$. In the second stage this object is pruned to get the final coalgebra A$\omega$+$\omega$. We give an example where A$\omega$ is the solution of the corresponding domain equation in the category of complete ultra-metric spaces.},

This allows us to define a category GSRel of generalized stochastic relations, which has measurable spaces as objects and LMPs as morphisms.

Differential privacy offers a strong statistical guarantee that the effect of the presence of any individual in a database will be negligible, even when an adversary has auxiliary knowledge. Much of the prior work in this area consists of proving algorithms to be differentially private one at a time; we propose to streamline this process with a functional language whose type system automatically guarantees differential privacy, allowing the programmer to write complex privacy-safe query programs in a flexible and compositional way. The key novelty is the way our type system captures function sensitivity, a measure of how much a function can magnify the distance between similar inputs: well-typed programs not only can't go wrong, they can't go too far on nearby inputs. Moreover, by introducing a monad for random computations, we can show that the established definition of differential privacy falls out naturally as a special case of this soundness principle. We develop examples including known differentially private algorithms, privacy-aware variants of standard functional programming idioms, and compositionality principles for differential privacy.},

Programs may use both higher-order functions and continuous distributions, or even define a probability distribution on functions. But standard probability theory does not handle higher-order functions well: the category of measurable spaces is not cartesian closed. Here we introduce quasi-Borel spaces. We show that these spaces: form a new formalization of probability theory replacing measurable spaces; form a cartesian closed category and so support higher-order functions; form a well-pointed category and so support good proof principles for equational reasoning; and support continuous probability distributions. We demonstrate the use of quasi-Borel spaces for higher-order functions and probability by: showing that a well-known construction of probability theory involving random functions gains a cleaner expression; and generalizing de Finetti's theorem, that is a crucial theorem in probability theory, to quasi-Borel spaces.},

The diagrammatic framework is stated in the graphical language of symmetric monoidal categories and of compact structures and Frobenius structures therein, in which Bayesian inversion boils down to transposition with respect to an appropriate compact structure. We characterize classical Bayesian inference in terms of a graphical property and demonstrate that our approach eliminates some purely conventional elements that appear in common representations thereof, such as whether degrees of belief are represented by probabilities or entropic quantities. We also introduce a quantum-like calculus wherein the Frobenius structure is noncommutative and show that it can accommodate Leifer's calculus of ‘conditional density operators'. The notion of conditional independence is also generalized to our graphical setting and we make some preliminary connections to the theory of Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct a graphical Bayesian calculus within any dagger compact category.},

Motivated by Bohr's idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from S(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized) truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).},

abstract = {The focus of this article is on probability theories based on non-boolean event spaces that have potential for scientific and philosophical applications. Since the early 1930s, such an alternative probability theory has been systematically used to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum physics. This article investigates in a general way feasible alternatives to boolean event algebras as bases for probability theories. Such alternatives permit new kinds of logical relationships among events that are not expressible in boolean event algebras. In psychology, these relationships allow for kinds of modeling methods that help account for various puzzling phenomena found throughout psychology, particularly in cognitive decision theory. The alternative probability theories presented are investigated through algebraic characterizations of their event spaces and probability functions. This is done using results from a well-developed area of mathematics known as “lattice theory”. This article describes the basics of lattice theory and how the interpretation of a few of its results indicates that generalizations of boolean event spaces are severely limited for useful application in scientific modeling. The overall conclusion is that two types of event spaces appear especially promising for generalization: One that captures key concepts of the logic inherent in quantum mechanics, “quantum logic”, and another that captures key concepts inherent in a generalization of classical logic that is used in the foundations of mathematics, “intuitionistic logic”. Both of these types of logical structures are useful for constructing unorthodox models of troublesome findings in behavioral economics. One theme of this article is the use of intuitionistic logic to model probabilistic judgments and decision making.},

Our design of both components improves in functionality and efficiency over prior work, as follows.Our circuit generator is the first to be universal: it does not need to know the program, but only a bound on its running time. Moreover, the size of the output circuit depends additively (rather than multiplicatively) on program size, allowing verification of larger programs.The cryptographic proof system improves proving and verification times, by leveraging new algorithms and a pairing library tailored to the protocol.We evaluated our system for programs with up to 10,000 instructions, running for up to 32,000 machine steps, each of which can arbitrarily access random-access memory; and also demonstrated it executing programs that use just-in-time compilation. Our proofs are 230 bytes long at 80 bits of security, or 288 bytes long at 128 bits of security. Typical verification time is 5 milliseconds, regardless of the original program's running time.},

In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a powerful tool for providing privacy-preserving noisy query answers over statistical databases. It guarantees that the distribution of noisy query answers changes very little with the addition or deletion of any tuple. It is frequently accompanied by popularized claims that it provides privacy without any assumptions about the data and that it protects against attackers who know all but one record. In this paper we critically analyze the privacy protections offered by differential privacy. First, we use a no-free-lunch theorem, which defines non-privacy as a game, to argue that it is not possible to provide privacy and utility without making assumptions about how the data are generated. Then we explain where assumptions are needed. We argue that privacy of an individual is preserved when it is possible to limit the inference of an attacker about the participation of the individual in the data generating process. This is different from limiting the inference about the presence of a tuple (for example, Bob's participation in a social network may cause edges to form between pairs of his friends, so that it affects more than just the tuple labeled as "Bob"). The definition of evidence of participation, in turn, depends on how the data are generated -- this is how assumptions enter the picture. We explain these ideas using examples from social network research as well as tabular data for which deterministic statistics have been previously released. In both cases the notion of participation varies, the use of differential privacy can lead to privacy breaches, and differential privacy does not always adequately limit inference about participation.},

Free monads and then extensible effects emerge from the straightforward term representation of an effectful computation, as more and more boilerplate is abstracted away. The generalization process further leads to freer monads, constructed without the Functor constraint. The continuation exposed in freer monads can then be represented as an efficient type-aligned data structure. The end result is the algorithmically efficient extensible effects library, which is not only more comprehensible but also faster than earlier implementations. As an illustration of the new library, we show three surprisingly simple applications: non-determinism with committed choice (LogicT), catching IO exceptions in the presence of other effects, and the semi-automatic management of file handles and other resources through monadic regions. We extensively use and promote the new sort of `laziness', which underlies the left Kan extension: instead of performing an operation, keep its operands and pretend it is done.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable discussion as to the appropriate definition of distributive categories. Three definitions which have had some support are: (1) A category with finite sums and products such that the canonical map ??:A??B+ A??C???A??(B+C) is an isomorphism (Walters). (2) A category with finite sums and products such that the canonical functor +:A/A?? A/B???A/(A+B) is an equivalence (Monro). (3) A category with finite sums and finite limits such that the canonical functor + of (2) is an equivalence (Lawvere and Schanuel). There has been some confusion as to which of these was the natural notion to consider. This resulted from the fact that there are actually two elementary notions being combined in the above three definitions. The first, to which we give the name distributivity, is exactly that of (1). The second notion, which we shall call extensivity, is that of a category with finite sums for which the canonical functor + of definitions (2) and (3) is an equivalence. Extensivity, although it implies the existence of certain pullbacks, is essentially a property of having well-behaved sums. It is the existence of these pullbacks which has caused the confusion. The connections between definition (1) and definitions (2) and (3) are that any extensive category with products is distributive in the first sense, and that any category satisfying (3) satisfies (1) locally. The purpose of this paper is to present some basic facts about extensive and distributive categories, and to discuss the relationships between the two notions. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Desharnais, Gupta, Jagadeesan and Panangaden introduced a family of behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic transition systems. These pseudometrics are a quantitative analogue of probabilistic bisimilarity. Distance zero captures probabilistic bisimilarity. Each pseudometric has a discount factor, a real number in the interval (0, 1]. The smaller the discount factor, the more the future is discounted. If the discount factor is one, then the future is not discounted at all. Desharnais et al. showed that the behavioural distances can be calculated up to any desired degree of accuracy if the discount factor is smaller than one. In this paper, we show that the distances can also be approximated if the future is not discounted. A key ingredient of our algorithm is Tarski's decision procedure for the first order theory over real closed fields. By exploiting the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem we can restrict to the existential fragment for which more efficient decision procedures exist.},

abstract = {Our main result is that any topological algebra based on a Boolean space is the extended Stone dual space of a certain associated Boolean algebra with additional operations. A particular case of this result is that the profinite completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space of the Boolean algebra of recognisable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with certain residuation operations. These results identify a connection between topological algebra as applied in algebra and Stone duality as applied in logic, and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer science is intrinsic to profinite completion in mathematics in general. This connection underlies a number of recent results in automata theory including a generalisation of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages and a new notion of compact recognition applicable beyond the setting of regular languages. The purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result in its general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a few applications in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we give a simple proof of the fact that any topological algebra quotient of a profinite algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is again profinite and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original Eilenberg theorem in a fully modular manner. We cast our results in the setting of extended Priestley duality for distributive lattices with additional operations as some classes of languages of interest in automata theory fail to be closed under complementation.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a widely studied theory for analyzing sensitive data with a strong privacy guaranteeÐ any change in an individual's data can have only a small statistical effect on the resultÐand a growing number of programming languages now support differentially private data analysis. A common shortcoming of these languages is poor support for adaptivity. In practice, a data analyst rarely wants to run just one function over a sensitive database, nor even a predetermined sequence of functions with fixed privacy parameters; rather, she wants to engage in an interaction where, at each step, both the choice of the next function and its privacy parameters are informed by the results of prior functions. Existing languages support this scenario using a simple composition theorem, which often gives rather loose bounds on the actual privacy cost of composite functions, substantially reducing how much computation can be performed within a given privacy budget. The theory of differential privacy includes other theorems with much better bounds, but these have not yet been incorporated into programming languages. We propose a novel framework for adaptive composition that is elegant, practical, and implementable. It consists of a reformulation based on typed functional programming of privacy filters, together with a concrete realization of this framework in the design and implementation of a new language, called Adaptive Fuzz. Adaptive Fuzz transplants the core static type system of Fuzz to the adaptive setting by wrapping the Fuzz typechecker and runtime system in an outer adaptive layer, allowing Fuzz programs to be conveniently constructed and typechecked on the fly. We describe an interpreter for Adaptive Fuzz and report results from two case studies demonstrating its effectiveness for implementing common statistical algorithms over real data sets.},

An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies. We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

abstract = {Ever since proposed by Dwork, differential privacy has been a hot topic in academia. However, few attempts have been made on reasoning about differential privacy at a system level. In this paper, we propose a formal framework to verify differential privacy in probabilistic systems. With a metric on the states of a system, we formalize differential privacy by the ratio of the probabilities in the distributions after the same labeled transitions of relevant states. We explain how traditional differential privacy can be embedded in our framework and raise an infimum metric, the least distance between two states, while not violating differential privacy. It is proven that the infimum metric is also a metric instance of differential privacy itself. Furthermore, we propose a two-level logic, a privacy variant of the familiar Hennessy–Milner logic, to characterize differential privacy in our framework. Our results have close relations to probabilistic bisimilarity as well.},

Here we extend the study of monad-quantale-enriched categories of the past fifteen years by introducing monad-quantaloid-enriched categories. We do so by making lax distributive laws of a monad $\mathbb{T}$ over the discrete presheaf monad of the small quantaloid $\mathcal{Q}$ the primary data of the theory, rather than the lax monad extensions of $\mathbb{T}$ to the category of $\mathcal{Q}$-relations that they equivalently describe. The central piece of the paper establishes a Galois correspondence between such lax distributive laws and lax Eilenberg-Moore $\mathbb{T}$-algebra structures on the set of discrete presheaves over the object set of $\mathcal{Q}$. We give a precise comparison of these structures with the more restrictive notion introduced by Hofmann in the case of a commutative quantale, called natural topological theories here, and describe the lax monad extensions introduced by him as minimal. Throughout the paper, a variety of old and new examples of ordered, metric and topological structures illustrate the theory developed, which includes the consideration of algebraic functors and change-of-base functors in full generality.},

@article{Birkedal2010,
abstract = {It is well known that one can use an adaptation of the inverse-limit construction to solve recursive equations in the category of complete ultrametric spaces. We show that this construction generalizes to a large class of categories with metric-space structure on each set of morphisms: the exact nature of the objects is less important. In particular, the construction immediately applies to categories where the objects are ultrametric spaces with 'extra structure', and where the morphisms preserve this extra structure. The generalization is inspired by classical domain-theoretic work by Smyth and Plotkin. For many of the categories we consider, there is a natural subcategory in which each set of morphisms is required to be a compact metric space. Our setting allows for a proof that such a subcategory always inherits solutions of recursive equations from the full category. As another application, we present a construction that relates solutions of generalized domain equations in the sense of Smyth and Plotkin to solutions of equations in our class of categories. Our primary motivation for solving generalized recursive metric-space equations comes from recent and ongoing work on Kripke-style models in which the sets of worlds must be recursively defined. We show a series of examples motivated by this line of work. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the functional programming community monads are known to offer a convenient and elegant abstraction for programming with probabil-ity distributions, but their use is often limited to very simple in-ference problems. We show that it is possible to use the monad abstraction to construct probabilistic models for machine learning, while still offering good performance of inference in challenging models. We use a GADT as an underlying representation of a prob-ability distribution and apply Sequential Monte Carlo-based meth-ods to achieve efficient inference. We define a formal semantics via measure theory.

A central problem in database theory is to find the reconstruction map, i.e., the inverse map of an injective decomposition map. It is proved here that when the decomposition, viewed as a hypergraph, is acyclic and the given dependencies are full implicational dependencies, then the reconstruction map is the natural join. Based on this, it is shown that there is a polynomial time algorithm to test for injectiveness of decompositions. {\textcopyright} 1984 Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {“Concentrated differential privacy” was recently introduced by Dwork and Rothblum as a relaxation of differential privacy, which permits sharper analyses of many privacy-preserving computations. We present an alternative formulation of the concept of concentrated differential privacy in terms of the R{\'{e}}nyi divergence between the distributions obtained by running an algorithm on neighboring inputs. With this reformulation in hand, we prove sharper quantitative results, establish lower bounds, and raise a few new questions. We also unify this approach with approximate differential privacy by giving an appropriate definition of “approximate concentrated differential privacy”.},

abstract = {In Monoidal Computer I, we introduced a categorical model of computation where the formal reasoning about computability was supported by the simple and popular diagrammatic language of string diagrams. In the present paper, we refine and extend that model of computation to support a formal complexity theory as well. This formalization brings to the foreground the concept of normal complexity measures, which allow decompositions akin to Kleene's normal form. Such measures turn out to be just those where evaluating the complexity of a program does not require substantially more resources than evaluating the program itself. The usual time and space complexity are thus normal measures, whereas the average and the randomized complexity measures are not. While the measures that are not normal provide important design time information about algorithms, and for theoretical analyses, normal measures can also be used at run time, as practical tools of computation, e.g. to set the bounds for hypothesis testing, inductive inference and algorithmic learning.},

The syntax of this logic, which is introduced uniformly with respect to a coalgebraic type functor, required to preserve weak pullbacks, extends that of classical propositional logic with a so-called coalgebraic cover modality depending on the type functor. Its semantics is defined in terms of a categorically defined relation lifting operation. As the main contributions of our paper we introduce a derivation system, and prove that it provides a sound and complete axiomatization for the collection of coalgebraically valid inequalities. Our soundness and completeness proof is algebraic, and we employ Pattinson's stratification method, showing that our derivation system can be stratified in countably many layers, corresponding to the modal depth of the formulas involved. In the proof of our main result we identify some new concepts and obtain some auxiliary results of independent interest. We survey properties of the notion of relation lifting, induced by an arbitrary but fixed set functor. We introduce a category of Boolean algebra presentations, and establish an adjunction between it and the category of Boolean algebras. Given the fact that our derivation system involves only formulas of depth one, it can be encoded as a endo-functor on Boolean algebras. We show that this functor is finitary and preserves embeddings, and we prove that the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of our logic can be identified with the initial algebra for this functor.},

Consider a collection of transactional data that contains detailed information about items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristics of the buyer, which can serve as links to his identity, the publication of such data is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlike most previous works, we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive, but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data, depending on the point of view of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee, the k m-anonymity, to limit the effects of the data dimensionality and we propose efficient algorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization instead of suppression, which is the most common practice in related works on such data. We develop an algorithm which finds the optimal solution, however, at a high cost which makes it inapplicable for large, realistic problems. Then, we propose two greedy heuristics, which scale much better and in most of the cases find a solution close to the optimal. The proposed algorithms are experimentally evaluated using real datasets.},

This paper investigates the theoretical underpinnings of this transformation in the categorical setting of monads. We argue that so-called absolute Kan Extensions underlie this program optimisation. It is known that every Kan extension gives rise to a monad, the codensity monad, and furthermore that every monad is isomorphic to a codensity monad. The end formula for Kan extensions then induces an implementation of the monad, which can be seen as the categorical counterpart of continuationpassing style. We show that several optimisations are instances of this scheme: Church representations and implementation of backtracking using success and failure continuations, among others. Furthermore, we develop the calculational properties of Kan extensions, powers and ends. In particular, we propose a two-dimensional notation based on string diagrams that aims to support e ective reasoning with Kan extensions.},

Still more recent work has emphasized the role of profiniteness in finite monoid theory. This paper fuses these three topics by means of a general study of profinite categories, with applications to C-varieties (pseudovarieties of categories) in general, to those C-varieties arising from M-varieties (pseudovarieties of monoids) in particular, to implicit operations on categories and to recognizable languages over graphs.},

abstract = {Computer security policies often are stated informally in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and resources; these policies can be qualitative or quantitative. To formally quantify confidentiality and integrity, a new model of quantitative information flow is proposed in which information flow is quantified as the change in the accuracy of an observers beliefs. This new model resolves anomalies present in previous quantitative information-flow models, which are based on change in uncertainty. And the new model is sufficiently general that it can be instantiated to measure either accuracy or uncertainty. To formalize security policies in general, a generalization of the theory of trace properties (originally developed for program verification) is proposed. Security policies are modeled as hyperproperties, which are sets of trace properties. Although important security policies, such as secure information flow, cannot be expressed as trace properties, they can be expressed as hyperproperties. Safety and liveness are generalized from trace properties to hyperproperties, and every hyperproperty is shown to be the intersection of a safety hyperproperty and a liveness hyperproperty. Verification, refinement, and topology of hyperproperties are also addressed. Hyperproperties for system representations beyond trace sets are investigated.},

abstract = {Building on the work of L. Moss on coalgebraic logic, we study in a general setting a class of infinitary modal logics for F-coalgebras, designed to capture simulation and bisimulation. We use work by A. Thijs on coalgebraic modelling of simulation, in terms of relators ?? as extensions of functors. We prove our logics can indeed capture simulation and bisimulation, i.e. the existence of a simulation (or bisimulation) is equivalent to the preservation of (or equivalence with respect to) certain classes of sentences. Moreover, we prove that one can characterize any given coalgebra up to simulation (and, in certain conditions, up to bisimulation) by a single sentence. We show that truth for this logic can be understood as a simulation relation itself, but with respect to a richer functor F moreover, it is the the largest simulation, i.e. the similarity relation between states of the coalgebra and elements of the language. This sheds a new perspective on the classical preservation and characterizability results, and also on logic games. The two kinds of games normally used in logic ("truth games" to define the semantics dynamically, and "similarity games" between two structures) are seen to be the same kind of game at the level of coalgebras: simulation games. This work has been carried out under the project SEN3.4 "PROMACS" . I thank Jan Rutten, Larry Moss, Martin Rossiger and Yde Venema for useful conversations and comments on the topics of this paper. ?? 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of protecting privacy in the publication of set-valued data. Consider a collection of supermarket transactions that contains detailed information about items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristics of the buyer, which can serve as links to his identity, the publication of such data is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlike most previous works, we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive, but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data, depending on the knowledge of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee, the k (m) -anonymity, to limit the effects of the data dimensionality, and we propose efficient algorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization instead of suppression, which is the most common practice in related works on such data. We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal solution, however, at a high cost that makes it inapplicable for large, realistic problems. Then, we propose a greedy heuristic, which performs generalizations in an Apriori, level-wise fashion. The heuristic scales much better and in most of the cases finds a solution close to the optimal. Finally, we investigate the application of techniques that partition the database and perform anonymization locally, aiming at the reduction of the memory consumption and further scalability. A thorough experimental evaluation with real datasets shows that a vertical partitioning approach achieves excellent results in practice.},

abstract = {A tension in language design has been between simple semantics on the one hand, and rich possibilities for side-effects, exception handling and so on on the other. The introduction of monads has made a large step towards reconciling these alternatives. First proposed by Moggi as a way of structuring semantic descriptions, they were adopted by Wadler to structure Haskell programs. Monads have been used to solve long-standing problems such as adding pointers and assignment, inter-language working, and exception handling to Haskell, without compromising its purely functional semantics. The course introduces monads, effects, and exemplifies their applications in programming (Haskell) and in compilation (MLj). The course presents typed metalanguages for monads and related categorical notions, and then describes how they can be further refined by introducing effects.},

We show that the expressiveness of an inductively defined logic for coalgebras w.r.t. a notion of simulation follows from an expressivity condition involving one stepin the definitionofthe logic, and the relator inducing that notion of simulation. Moreover, we show that notions of simulation and associated characterising logics for increasingly complex system types can be derived by lifting the operations used to combine system types, to a relational level as well as to a logical level. We use these results to obtain Baltag's logic for coalgebraic simulation, as well as notions of simulation and associated logics for a large class of non-deterministic and probabilistic systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.

Formerly the theory of coalgebras has been employed mostly in Sets where coinduction yields a finer process semantics of bisimilarity.

The relational model is solidly based on two parts of mathematics: firstorder predicate logic and the theory of relations. This book, however, does not dwell on the theoretical foundations, but rather on all the features of the relational model that I now perceive as important for database users, and therefore for DBMS vendors. My perceptions result from 20 years of practical experience in computing and data processing (chiefly, but not exclusively, with large-scale customers of IBM), followed by another 20 years of research. I believe that this is the first book to deal exclusively with the relational approach. It does, however, include design principles in Chapters 21 and 22. It is also the first book on the relational model by the originator of that model. All the ideas in the relational model described in this book are mine, except in cases where I explicitly credit someone else. In developing the relational model, I have tried to follow Einstein's advice, "Make it as simple as possible, but no simpler." I believe that in the last clause he was discouraging the pursuit of simplicity to the extent of distorting reality. So why does the book contain 30 chapters and two appendixes? To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the history of research and development of the relational model.},

Desirable properties of the category of algebras - existence of free ones, cocompleteness, existence of adjoints to algebraic functors - all follow if this category can be proved reflective in some well-behaved category: for which we choose a certain comma-category T/A We show that the reflexion exists and is given as the colimit of a simple transfinite sequence, if A is cocomplete and the Tk preserve either colimits or unions of suitably-long chains of subobjects. The article draws heavily on the work of earlier authors, unifies and simplifies this, and extends it to new problems.

abstract = {Writing formal specifications for distributed systems is difficult. Even simple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of the complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information is available in every component, and information transmitted from other components may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of faults. The problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal specification is, in general, undecidable. Semi-algorithms for synthesis, such as bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they construct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the negative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the implementation never terminates. In this paper, we introduce counterexamples to distributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such counterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). A counterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different sequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the components are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of these paths. We present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the classic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant realizability problem. Our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger sets of paths until a counterexample is found. For safety specifications in weakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while counterexamples for full LTL and arbitrary architectures may consist of infinitely many paths. Experimental results, obtained with a QBF-based prototype implementation, show that our method finds simple errors very quickly, and even problems with high combinatorial complexity, like the Byzantine Generals' Problem, are tractable.},

These findings shift the perceived utility of SNPs for identifying individual trace contributors within a forensics mixture, and suggest future research efforts into assessing the viability of previously sub-optimal DNA sources due to sample contamination. These findings also suggest that composite statistics across cohorts, such as allele frequency or genotype counts, do not mask identity within genome-wide association studies.

The second half of the book introduces time into the language, brings in the timed semantic model (timed failures) and finally presents the theory of timewise refinement which links the two halves together.

abstract = {For over fifty years, “record linkage” procedures have been refined to integrate data in the face of typographical and semantic errors. These procedures are traditionally performed over personal identifiers (e.g., names), but in modern decentralized environments, privacy concerns have led to regulations that require the obfuscation of such attributes. Various techniques have been proposed to resolve the tension, including secure multi-party computation protocols, however, such protocols are computationally intensive and do not scale for real world linkage scenarios. More recently, procedures based on Bloom filter encoding (BFE) have gained traction in various applications, such as healthcare, where they yield highly accurate record linkage results in a reasonable amount of time. Though promising, no formal security analysis has been designed or applied to this emerging model, which is of concern considering the sensitivity of the corresponding data. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack, based on constraint satisfaction, to provide a rigorous analysis for BFE and guidelines regarding how to mitigate risk against the attack. In addition, we conduct an empirical analysis with data derived from public voter records to illustrate the feasibility of the attack. Our investigations show that the parameters of the BFE protocol can be configured to make it relatively resilient to the proposed attack without significant reduction in record linkage performance.},

abstract = {As the complexity of programs increase, so does the complexity of the models required to reason about them. Process calculi were introduced in the early 1980s and have since then been used to model communication protocols of varying size and scope. Whereas modeling sophisticated protocols in simple process algebras like CCS or the pi-calculus is doable, expressing the models required is often gruesome and error prone. To combat this, more advanced process calculi were introduced, which significantly reduce the complexity of the models. However, this simplicity comes at a price -- the theories of the calculi themselves instead become gruesome and error prone, and establishing their mathematical and logical properties has turned out to be difficult. Many of the proposed calculi have later turned out to be inconsistent.\n\nThe contribution of this thesis is twofold. Firstly we provide methodologies to formalise the meta-theory of process calculi in an interactive theorem prover. These are used to formalise significant parts of the meta-theory of CCS and the pi-calculus in the theorem prover Isabelle, using Nominal Logic to allow for a smooth treatment of the binders. Secondly we introduce and formalise psi-calculi, a framework for process calculi incorporating several existing ones, including those we already formalised, and which is significantly simpler and substantially more expressive. Our methods scale well as complexity of the calculi increases.\n\nThe formalised results include congruence results for both strong and weak bisimilarities, in the case of the pi-calculus for both the early and the late operational semantics. We also formalise the proof that the axiomatisation of strong late bisimilarity is sound and complete in the finite pi-calculus. We believe psi-calculi to be one of the most expressive frameworks for mobile process calculi, and our Isabelle formalisation to be the most extensive formalisation of process calculi ever done inside a theorem prover.},

Examples include sequential spaces, P-spaces and countably tight spaces. T-algebras are characterized as the T-compact, T-Hausdorff T-spaces. Malyhin's theorem on countable tightness generalizes verbatim to TopG for any G ??? ??. For r??? ??{star operator} = ?? ?? \ ??, let Gr be the subfunctor of ?? generated by r and let Tr be the generated submonad. If ???RK is the Rudin-Keisler preorder on ??{star operator}, r ???RK s ??? Gr ??? Gs. Let ???c be the Comfort preorder and define the monadic preorderr ???m s to mean Tr ??? Ts. Then r ???RK s ??? r ???m s ??? r ???c s. It follows that there exist 2c monadic types. For each such type Tr, the Tr-algebras form an equationally definable full subcategory of topological spaces with only one operation of countably infinite arity. No two of these varieties are term equivalent nor is any one a full subcategory of another inside topological spaces. Say that r ??? ??{star operator} is an m-point if Gr ??? Tr. Under CH, m-points exist. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of `influence' among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical framework for the analysis of privacy and security tradeoffs in secure biometric authentication systems. We use this framework to conduct a comparative information-theoretic analysis of two biometric systems that are based on linear error correction codes, namely fuzzy commitment and secure sketches. We derive upper bounds for the probability of false rejection ($P_{FR}$) and false acceptance ($P_{FA}$) for these systems. We use mutual information to quantify the information leaked about a user's biometric identity, in the scenario where one or multiple biometric enrollments of the user are fully or partially compromised. We also quantify the probability of successful attack ($P_{SA}$) based on the compromised information. Our analysis reveals that fuzzy commitment and secure sketch systems have identical $P_{FR}, P_{FA}, P_{SA}$ and information leakage, but secure sketch systems have lower storage requirements. We analyze both single-factor (keyless) and two-factor (key-based) variants of secure biometrics, and consider the most general scenarios in which a single user may provide noisy biometric enrollments at several access control devices, some of which may be subsequently compromised by an attacker. Our analysis highlights the revocability and reusability properties of key-based systems and exposes a subtle design tradeoff between reducing information leakage from compromised systems and preventing successful attacks on systems whose data have not been compromised.},

abstract = {Fixed point logics are widely used in computer science, in particular in artificial intelligence and concurrency. The most expressive logics of this type are the $\mu$-calculus and its relatives. However, popular fixed point logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and readability, and in fact often live within the single variable fragment of the $\mu$-calculus. The family of such flat fixed point logics includes, e.g., CTL, the *-nesting-free fragment of PDL, and the logic of common knowledge. Here, we extend this notion to the generic semantic framework of coalgebraic logic, thus covering a wide range of logics beyond the standard $\mu$-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the graded $\mu$-calculus and the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (such as ATL), as well as probabilistic and monotone fixed point logics. Our main results are completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization and a timed-out tableaux method that matches ExpTime upper bounds inherited from the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus but avoids using automata.},

This necessary condition is not usually sufficient, however; for that we need a refinement of the Lefschetz number called the Reidemeister trace. Abstractly, the Lefschetz number is a trace in a symmetric monoidal category, while the Reidemeister trace is a trace in a bicategory; in this paper we relate these contexts using indexed symmetric monoidal categories. In particular, we will show that for any symmetric monoidal category with an associated indexed symmetric monoidal category, there is an associated bicategory which produces refinements of trace analogous to the Reidemeister trace. This bicategory also produces a new notion of trace for parametrized spaces with dualizable fibers, which refines the obvious "fiberwise" traces by incorporating the action of the fundamental group of the base space. We also advance the basic theory of indexed monoidal categories, including introducing a string diagram calculus which makes calculations much more tractable. This abstract framework lays the foundation for generalizations of these ideas to other contexts.},

abstract = {In recent years, the wide availability of per- sonal data has made the problem of privacy preserving data mining an important one. A number of methods have recently been pro- posed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that meth- ods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively im- plement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data be- comes sparse, and the concept of spatial local- ity is no longer easy to define from an applica- tion point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspec- tive of inference attacks over all possible com- binations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data with- out an unacceptably high amount of infor- mation loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially spec- ified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity.

abstract = {Dependently typed programming languages allow sophisticated properties of data to be expressed within the type system. Of particular use in dependently typed programming are indexed types that refine data by computationally useful information. For example, the N-indexed type of vectors refines lists by their lengths. Other data types may be refined in similar ways, but programmers must produce purpose-specific refinements on an ad hoc basis, developers must anticipate which refinements to include in libraries, and implementations must often store redundant information about data and their refinements. In this paper we show how to generically derive inductive characterisations of refinements of inductive types, and argue that these characterisations can alleviate some of the aforementioned difficulties associated with ad hoc refinements. Our characterisations also ensure that standard techniques for programming with and reasoning about inductive types are applicable to refinements, and that refinements can themselves be further refined.},

abstract = {Re-identification is a major privacy threat to public datasets containing individual records. Many privacy protection algorithms rely on generalization and suppression of "quasi-identifier" attributes such as ZIP code and birthdate. Their objective is usually syntactic sanitization: for example, k-anonymity requires that each "quasi-identifier" tuple appear in at least k records, while l-diversity requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes for each quasi-identifier have high entropy. The utility of sanitized data is also measured syntactically, by the number of generalization steps applied or the number of records with the same quasi-identifier. In this paper, we ask whether generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers offer any benefits over trivial sanitization which simply separates quasi-identifiers from sensitive attributes. Previous work showed that k-anonymous databases can be useful for data mining, but k-anonymization does not guarantee any privacy. By contrast, we measure the tradeoff between privacy (how much can the adversary learn from the sanitized records?) and utility, measured as accuracy of data-mining algorithms executed on the same sanitized records. For our experimental evaluation, we use the same datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as were used in previous research on generalization and suppression. Our results demonstrate that even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility. In most cases, trivial sanitization provides equivalent utility and better privacy than k-anonymity, l-diversity, and similar methods based on generalization and suppression.},

First we present two axiomatizations of this operator, and we prove these axiomatizations to be sound and complete with respect to basic modal and positive modal logic, respectively. More precisely, we introduce the notions of a modal ∇ -algebra and of a positive modal ∇ -algebra. We establish a categorical isomorphism between the category of modal ∇ -algebra and that of modal algebras, and similarly for positive modal ∇ -algebras and positive modal algebras. We then turn to a presentation, in terms of relation lifting, of the Vietoris hyperspace in topology. The key ingredient is an F-lifting construction, for an arbitrary set functor F, on the category Chu of two-valued Chu spaces and Chu transforms, based on relation lifting. As a case study, we show how to realize the Vietoris construction on Stone spaces as a special instance of this Chu construction for the (finite) power set functor. Finally, we establish a tight connection with the axiomatization of the modal ∇ -algebras.},

abstract = {Exception handling is provided by most modern programming languages. It allows to deal with anomalous or exceptional events which require special processing. In computer algebra, exception handling is an efficient way to implement the dynamic evaluation paradigm: for instance, in linear algebra, dynamic evaluation can be used for applying programs which have been written for matrices with coefficients in a field to matrices with coefficients in a ring. Thus, a proof system for computer algebra should include a treatement of exceptions, which must rely on a careful description of a semantics of exceptions. The categorical notion of monad can be used for formalizing the raising of exceptions: this has been proposed by Moggi and implemented in Haskell. In this paper, we provide a proof system for exceptions which involves both raising and handling, by extending Moggi's approach. Moreover, the core part of this proof system is dual to a proof system for side effects in imperative languages, which relies on the categorical notion of comonad. Both proof systems are implemented in the Coq proof assistant.},

We define typed versions of may and must equivalences for the security ??-calculus, where the tests are parameterised relative to a security level. We provide alternative characterisations of these equivalences in terms of actions in context; these describe the actions a process may perform in a given typing environment, assuming the observer is constrained by a related, but possibly different, environment.

The sanitization may be in the form of an arbitrary data structure, accompanied by a computational procedure for determining approximate answers to queries on the original data set, or it may be a "synthetic data set" consisting of data items drawn from the same universe as items in the original data set; queries are carried out as if the synthetic data set were the actual input. In either case the process is non-interactive; once the sanitization has been released the original data and the curator play no further role. For the task of sanitizing with a synthetic dataset output, we map the boundary between computational feasibility and infeasibility with respect to a variety of utility measures. For the (potentially easier) task of sanitizing with unrestricted output format, we show a tight qualitative and quantitative connection between hardness of sanitizing and the existence of traitor tracing schemes.},

We define combinators for measure transformers, based on theorems in measure theory, and use these to give a rigorous semantics to our core calculus. The original features of our semantics include its support for discrete, continuous, and hybrid measures, and, in particular, for observations of zero-probability events. We compile our core language to a small imperative lan- guage that has a straightforward semantics via factor graphs, data structures that enable many efficient inference algorithms.

abstract = {We study the notion of stratification, as used in subsystems of linear logic with low complexity bounds on the cut-elimination procedure (the so-called light logics), from an abstract point of view, introducing a logical system in which stratification is handled by a separate modality. This modality, which is a generalization of the paragraph modality of Girard's light linear logic, arises from a general categorical construction applicable to all models of linear logic. We thus learn that stratification may be formulated independently of exponential modalities; when it is forced to be connected to exponential modalities, it yields interesting complexity properties. In particular, from our analysis stem three alternative reformulations of Baillot and Mazza's linear logic by levels: one geometric, one interactive, and one semantic.},

In our formalism, database schemas and instances are algebraic (multi-sorted equational) theories of a certain form. Schemas denote categories, and instances denote their initial (term) algebras. The instances on a schema S form a category, S – Inst , and a morphism of schemas F : S → T induces three adjoint data migration functors: $\Sigma$ F : S – Inst → T – Inst , defined by substitution along F , which has a right adjoint $\Delta$ F : T – Inst → S – Inst , which in turn has a right adjoint $\Pi$ F : S – Inst → T – Inst . We present a query language based on for/where/return syntax where each query denotes a sequence of data migration functors; a pushout-based design pattern for performing data integration using our formalism; and describe the implementation of our formalism in a tool we call AQL (Algebraic Query Language).},

abstract = {Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life. Many branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For example, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication channel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum information theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where chemical reaction equations such as \mathrm{2H_2 + O_2} \lra \mathrm{2H_2O,} are concerned both with a convertibility relation ‘→' and a combination operation ‘+.' We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and functional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should have applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of conversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are also of purely mathematical interest without the resource-theoretic interpretation, we exemplify our results with the ordered commutative monoid of graphs.},

abstract = {Effects and coeffects are two general, complementary aspects of program behaviour. They roughly correspond to computations which change the execution context (effects) versus computations which make demands on the context (coeffects). Effectful features include partiality, non-determinism, input-output, state, and exceptions. Coeffectful features include resource demands, variable access, notions of linearity, and data input requirements. The effectful or coeffectful behaviour of a program can be captured and described via type-based analyses, with fine grained information provided by monoidal effect annotations and semiring coeffects. Various recent work has proposed models for such typed calculi in terms of graded (strong) monads for effects and graded (monoidal) comonads for coeffects. Effects and coeffects have been studied separately so far, but in practice many computations are both effectful and coeffectful, e.g., possibly throwing exceptions but with resource requirements. To remedy this, we introduce a new general calculus with a combined effect-coeffect system. This can describe both the changes and requirements that a program has on its context, as well as interactions between these effectful and coeffectful features of computation. The effect-coeffect system has a denotational model in terms of effect-graded monads and coeffect-graded comonads where interaction is expressed via the novel concept of graded distributive laws. This graded semantics unifies the syntactic type theory with the denotational model. We show that our calculus can be instantiated to describe in a natural way various different kinds of interaction between a program and its evaluation context.},

Compared to those previous methods based on partition-based privacy models (e.g., k-anonymity), differential privacy provides strong privacy guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge. However, the existing solutions based on differential privacy for data publication are currently limited to static datasets, and do not adequately address today's demand for up-to-date information. In this paper, we address the problem of differentially private set-valued data release on an incremental scenario in which the data need to be transformed are not static. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient algorithm, called IncTDPart, to incrementally generate a series of differentially private releases. The proposed algorithm is based on top-down partitioning model with the help of item-free taxonomy tree and update-bounded mechanism. Extensive experiments on real datasets confirm that our approach maintains high utility and scalability for counting query.},

We establish several preservation properties for these representations, including a generalization of Day's embedding theorem for monoidal closed categories. Then we establish that the positive and negative representations satisfy an Isbell-style duality. As corollaries, we derive two different formulas for the positive representation of a pushforward (inspired by the classical negative translations of proof theory), which express it either as the dual of a pullback of a dual, or as the double dual of a pushforward. Besides explaining how these constructions on refinement systems generalize familiar category-theoretic ones (by viewing categories as special refinement systems), our main running examples involve representations of Hoare Logic and linear sequent calculus.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a precise mathematical constraint meant to ensure privacy of individual pieces of information in a database even while queries are being answered about the aggregate. Intuitively, one must come to terms with what differential privacy does and does not guarantee. For example, the definition prevents a strong adversary who knows all but one entry in the database from further inferring about the last one. This strong adversary assumption can be overlooked, resulting in misinterpretation of the privacy guarantee of differential privacy. Herein we give an equivalent definition of privacy using mutual information that makes plain some of the subtleties of differential privacy. The mutual-information differential privacy is in fact sandwiched between $\epsilon$-differential privacy and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy in terms of its strength. In contrast to previous works using unconditional mutual information, differential privacy is fundamentally related to conditional mutual information, accompanied by a maximization over the database distribution. The conceptual advantage of using mutual information, aside from yielding a simpler and more intuitive definition of differential privacy, is that its properties are well understood. Several properties of differential privacy are easily verified for the mutual information alternative, such as composition theorems.},

@article{Bacchus1996,
abstract = {An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly from the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other nondeductive reasoning systems.},

abstract = {We investigate some basic questions about the interaction of regular and\nrational relations on words. The primary motivation comes from the study of\nlogics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous\napplications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular\nlanguages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational\nrelations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended\ngraph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of\nrational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,\nto the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a\nregular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).\n We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the\nintersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for\nsubword or su?x, and some generalizations), or decidable with\nnon-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its\ngeneralizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph\nlogics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to\nprovide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that\nhas non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for\nlogics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations\non paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classi?es them into\neither e?ciently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of\nrational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic\nrestrictions.},

This paper investigates the hardness of precisely checking the quantitative information flow of a program according to such definitions. More precisely, we study the "bounding problem" of quantitative information flow, defined as follows: Given a program M and a positive real number q, decide if the quantitative information flow of M is less than or equal to q. We prove that the bounding problem is not a k-safety property for any k (even when q is fixed, for the Shannon-entropy-based definition with the uniform distribution), and therefore is not amenable to the self-composition technique that has been successfully applied to checking non-interference. We also prove complexity theoretic hardness results for the case when the program is restricted to loop-free boolean programs. Specifically, we show that the problem is PP-hard for all definitions, showing a gap with non-interference which is coNP-complete for the same class of programs. The paper also compares the results with the recently proved results on the comparison problems of quantitative information flow.},

abstract = {Coalgebras are of growing importance in theoretical computer science. To develop languages for them is significant for the specification and verification of systems. Modallogic has proved to be suitable for this purpose. So far, most approaches have presented a language to describe only deterministic coalgebras. The present paper introduces a generalization that also covers non-deterministic systems. Models for our modal language are F-coalgebras where the functor F is inductively constructed from constant sets and the identity functor using product, coproduct, exponentiation, and the power set functor. Thus, Kripke-structures constitute a special case. First we introduce a language that is based on a multisorted modal setting: here the sorts are given by the subfunctors of F. Then we consider a restricted language that still has the same expressiveness. It turns out that, for the case of Kripke-structures, the obtained language is equivalent to the “usual” modallogic for these structures. Hence this approach actually constitutes a bridge between modal languages for coalgebras and the modallogic for Kripke-structures. A well-known result from modallogic can be transfered to our setting: for so-called image-finite coalgebras bisimilarity coincides with logical equivalence. Finally, we present a sound and complete deduction calculus in case the constants in F are finite.},

The representation of $\Lambda$(MHA) is also given. All these provide us with a satisfactory insight into $\Lambda$(MHA).

Additionally, applica- tions of parametric polymorphism are also presented. The first part of the thesis presents a theoretical investigation of the se- mantics of parametric polymorphism of and within type-theories with de- pendent types. It is shown how the meaning of polymorphic, possibly dependent, types can be reflected within type-theory itself, via a simple syntactic transformation. This self-referential property opens the door to internalise the transformation in type-theory, and we study one possible way to do so. We also examine how the translation relates to various spe- cific features of type-theory, such as proof irrelevance and realizability. The second part is concerned an application of parametric polymorphism relevant to software engineers. We present a schema to reduce polymor- phic properties to equivalent monomorphic properties, for the purpose of testing. Our proof uses parametricity and properties of initial algebras.},

Using a connection that models machines on the one hand, and the data they manipulate on the other, testing is used to capture the interactions of each with the objects on the other side: just as the data that are input into a machine can be viewed as tests that the machine can be subjected to, the machine can be viewed as a test that can be used to distinguish data. This approach is based on generalizing from duality theories that now are common in semantics to logical connections, which are simply contravariant adjunctions. In the process, it accomplishes much more than simply moving from one side of a duality to the other; it faithfully represents the interactions that embody what is happening as the computation proceeds. Our basic philosophy is that tests can be used as a basis for modeling interactions, as well as processes and the data on which they operate. In more abstract terms, tests can be viewed as formulas of process logics, and testing semantics connects processes and process logics, and assigns computational meanings to both.},

In the last few years, two approaches, somewhat incomparable at first sight, captured successfully in a coalgebraic setting trace semantics for various types of transition systems. The first development of coalgebraic trace semantics used final coalgebras in Kleisli categories and required some non-trivial assumptions, which do not always hold, even in cases where one can reasonably speak of traces (like for weighted automata). The second development stemmed from the observation that trace semantics can also arise by performing a determinization construction and used final coalgebras in Eilenberg-Moore categories. In this paper, we develop a systematic study in which the two approaches can be studied and compared. Notably, we show that the two different views on trace semantics are equivalent, in the examples where both approaches are applicable.},

We develop the notion of a dense 2-monad on -Cat and characterise free F-cocompletions by dense KZ-monads on -Cat. We prove various corollaries about the structure of such 2-monads and their Kleisli 2-categories, as needed for the use of open maps in giving an axiomatic study of bisimulation in concurrency. This requires the introduction of the concept of a pseudo-commutativity for a strong 2-monad on a symmetric monoidal 2-category, and a characterisation of it in terms of structure on the Kleisli 2-category.},

Nevertheless, we also demonstrate that relational lattices are not as intangible as one may fear: for example, they do form a pseudoelementary class. We also apply the tools of Formal Concept Analysis and investigate the structure of relational lattices via their standard contexts. Furthermore, we show that the addition of typing rules and singleton constants allows a direct comparison with monotonic relational expressions of Sagiv and Yannakakis.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We argue that type spaces are coalgebras, that universal type spaces are final coalgebras, and that the modal logics already proposed in the economic theory literature are closely related to those in recent work in coalgebraic modal logic. In the other direction, the categories of interest in this work are usually measurable spaces or compact (Hausdorff) topological spaces. A coalgebraic version of the construction of the universal type space due to Heifetz and Samet [Journal of Economic Theory 82 (2) (1998) 324–341] is generalized for some functors in those categories. Since the concrete categories of interest have not been explored so deeply in the coalgebra literature, we have some new results. We show that every functor on the category of measurable spaces built from constant functors, products, coproducts, and the probability measure space functor has a final coalgebra. Moreover, we construct this final coalgebra from the relevant version of coalgebraic modal logic. Specifically, we consider the set of theories of points in all coalgebras and endow this set with a measurable and coalgebra structure.},

abstract = {$\kappa$-anonymity and $\epsilon$-differential privacy are two mainstream privacy models, the former introduced to anonymize data sets and the latter to limit the knowledge gain that results from including one individual in the data set. Whereas basic $\kappa$-anonymity only protects against identity disclosure, t-closeness was presented as an extension of $\kappa$-anonymity that also protects against attribute disclosure. We show here that, if not quite equivalent, t-closeness and $\epsilon$-differential privacy are strongly related to one another when it comes to anonymizing data sets. Specifically, $\kappa$-anonymity for the quasi-identifiers combined with $\epsilon$-differential privacy for the confidential attributes yields stochastic t-closeness (an extension of t-closeness), with t a function of $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$ Conversely, t-closeness can yield $\epsilon$-differential privacy when t = exp($\epsilon$/2) and the assumptions made by t-closeness about the prior and posterior views of the data hold.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a rigorous, worst-case notion of privacy-preserving computation. Informally, a probabilistic program is differentially private if the participation of a single individual in the input database has a limited effect on the program's distribution on outputs. More technically, differential privacy is a quantitative 2-safety property that bounds the distance between the output distributions of a probabilistic program on adjacent inputs. Like many 2-safety properties, differential privacy lies outside the scope of traditional verification techniques. Existing approaches to enforce privacy are based on intricate, non-conventional type systems, or customized relational logics. These approaches are difficult to implement and often cumbersome to use. We present an alternative approach that verifies differential privacy by standard, non-relational reasoning on non-probabilistic programs. Our approach transforms a probabilistic program into a non-probabilistic program which simulates two executions of the original program. We prove that if the target program is correct with respect to a Hoare specification, then the original probabilistic program is differentially private. We provide a variety of examples from the differential privacy literature to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Finally, we compare our approach with existing verification techniques for privacy.},

In particular, we prove that the Vietoris topology of a quasi-uniform space (X,U) is compatible with the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity on the family K 0(X) of nonempty compact subsets of X, if and only if for each K∈K 0(X),U -1 K is precompact. We show that for a T 1 quasi-uniform space (X,U), the Vietoris topology is compatible with the Hausdorff quasi-uniformity on the family of nonempty closed subsets of X, if and only if U is equinormal and U -1 is hereditarily precompact. We also discuss the problem in the setting of quasi-metric spaces and show, among other results, that the Vietoris topology of a quasi-metric space (X,d) is compatible with the Hausdorff extended quasi-pseudo-metric on the family of nonempty subsets of X, if and only if the quasi-uniformity induced by d coincides with the Pervin quasi-uniformity of X. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Computer scientists have recently undermined our faith in the privacy- protecting power of anonymization, the name for techniques that protect the privacy of individuals in large databases by deleting information like names and social security numbers. These scientists have demonstrated that they can often “reidentify” or “deanonymize” individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention. We must respond to the surprising failure of anonymization, and this Article provides the tools to do so.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of checking whether an organization conforms to a body of regulation. Conformance is cast as a trace checking question {\^{a}}€“ the regulation is represented in a logic that is evaluated against an abstract trace or run representing the operations of an organization. We focus on a problem in designing a logic to represent regulation.\nA common phenomenon in regulatory texts is for sentences to refer to others for conditions or exceptions. We motivate the need for a formal representation of regulation to accomodate such references between statements. We then extend linear temporal logic to allow statements to refer to others. The semantics of the resulting logic is defined via a combination of techniques from Reiter{\^{a}}€™s default logic and Kripke{\^{a}}€™s theory of truth.\n},

Special emphasis will be made on characterizing the barrier properties of grafted PEG layers and how a hierarchical approach that uses a short barrier and extended ligand allows us to start to mimic nature's own solution to the problem of ubiquitous repulsion and specific attraction. The information gained from such studies not only characterizes the membrane and other lipid surfaces and their intersurface interactions from a fundamental materials science perspective, but also provides essential materials property data that are required for the successful design and deployment of lipid-based carriers and other capsules in applications involving this so-called 'stealthy' surface.
